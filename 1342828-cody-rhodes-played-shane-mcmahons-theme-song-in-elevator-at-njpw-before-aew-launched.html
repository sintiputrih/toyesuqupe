Rhodes says that he was excited about being able to make “large money” again, referring to how he’d walked away from the large paydays that a WWE contract could offer.</p><p>Cody said he couldn’t tell many people about what was actually coming with AEW, so he’d play the song on the elevator… so much so that he told Shane he feels like he ruined the song.</p><p>“This is not really a Shane McMahon story. So you had mentioned the excursion I went on, but when I plugged back into like, alright, not even just WWE. When we were starting up the other promotion, the money was large. I had been away from the large money for a while, and I was in the Tokyo Dome hotel, getting ready to do this big show, Wrestle Kingdom, it’s a great show. But I knew in a few weeks, it was gonna go down. We were gonna announce [AEW] to the world. We’re gonna be on an actual, real network. This is happening. So Shane’s music is ‘Here comes the money,’ it’s like a very signature music. So every time I get on the elevator with the other guys who were in the group with me, I would play that music. There was all these other wrestlers who would [look at us]. We were the enemy. We were leaving, they didn’t know why. I just played it to the point like now I can’t see Shane and not be like, ‘Man, I ruined your song. I played it everywhere.'”</p><p>During his time away from WWE, Cody worked the independent scene and had runs with TNA Wrestling, Ring Of Honor and New Japan Pro-Wrestling. All Elite Wrestling officially launched on January 1, 2019, and he spent the past three years with the promotion.</p><p>Rhodes returned to WWE on April 2, 2022 at WrestleMania 38. He will challenge Roman Reigns for the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship at WrestleMania 39.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I think I finally have all the merch I'm going to need for the <a href=#>@IAmJericho</a> <a href=#>@jericho_cruise</a>.
