Cole</a> playing the track for him and he was digging it. It has become a fan-favorite since its release in November, receiving 5.5 million views on YouTube. To keep the momentum going for Dugg, he is back with "Wock N Red." London on da Track has a production credit on this one, as he brings a murderous tone to match Dugg's violent lyrics.
