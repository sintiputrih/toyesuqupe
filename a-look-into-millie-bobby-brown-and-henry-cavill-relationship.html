She made a contrast between herself and her Stranger Things co-stars, Noah Schnapp and Charlie Heaton, saying:</p><p>‚ÄúBecause I grew up with Noah and Charlie, it‚Äôs different. I first met them when I was ten years old. So it does seem like your classmates to me. And it seems like a true grownup connection with Henry. Like a very nice, extremely healthy relationship. We have terms and conditions for one.‚Äù</p><p>Enola Holmes, a 2020 mystery drama film starring Millie Bobby Brown and Henry Cavill, was their first collaboration. Bobby portrayed the title character, while Cavill played her brother, detective Sherlock Holmes. Sam Claflin played Mycroft Holmes in the first film. In the sequel, he did not repeat his part.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>beautiful dynamic and great friendship.

He has agreed to terms with me. I‚Äôm not permitted to inquire about his personal life. ‚ÄòMillie, shut up,‚Äô it says. No.‚Äô And I say, ‚ÄòUnderstood.'‚Äù</p><p>Stranger Things, a sci-fi drama series created by the Duffer Brothers, gave Millie Bobby Brown her big-screen debut. In the series, she plays Eleven, with Finn Wolfhard, Winona Ryder, David Harbour, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin, Natalia Dyer, Charlie Heaton, Joe Keery, and Noah Schnapp.&nbsp;Brown met and connected with her co-stars when she was 10 years old. Millie Bobby Brown remarked that there was honesty among the kid performers on the program.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Millie-Bobby-Brown-1.jpg alt="Millie Bobby Brown" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the same for the Stranger Things kids. There are no limits since we‚Äôre all siblings. But Henry is really rigorous with me, which I enjoy.‚Äù</p><p>Earlier in the interview, Millie Bobby Brown described Cavill as a ‚Äúreally sensible guy‚Äù who tolerates her poking and teasing.</p><p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs surprising since he has no sisters. So it must be absolutely different for him. I have a younger brother, a sister, and an older brother. So I‚Äôm very accustomed to that type of dynamic. I had to include a lot of it into my off-screen and on-screen interaction with Henry in order to push him out of his comfort zone.‚Äù</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Henry-Cavill.jpg alt="Henry Cavill" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Brown and Cavill were last seen in Enola Holmes 2, which debuted on Netflix on October 27.
