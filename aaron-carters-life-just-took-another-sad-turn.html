According to <a href=#>The U.S. Sun,</a> the former child star claimed it was his choice to go to an outpatient rehab program to get custody of his 9-month-old baby. In a September 13, 2022, interview, Carter told The Sun, "It's an abstinence program, and I work with an individual counselor." The 34-year-old explained, "I do group therapy, parenting classes, domestic violence classes, I got myself certified in CPR, just a lot of different things." The former "House of Carter" star told the outlet the "main reason" he enrolled in Lionrock Recovery was "to help with the weed."</p><p><a href=#>Page Six</a> reported that the singer and his fianc√©e Melanie Martin don't have custody of their baby because of "domestic violence and drug use concerns" by the court. Prince is being taken care of by Martin's mother due to a court mandate. According to Page Six, Martin claimed Carter fractured her ribs during an argument earlier this year but then recanted her claim.</p><p>It is not Carter's first stint in rehab. In 2017, <a href=#>People</a> reported the former child star left an in-patient rehab facility after only two weeks. His spokesperson told the publication, "Aaron has left the facility where he has been working on his wellness. Several legal and personal matters arose that required his immediate and in-person attention."</p><p>If you or someone you know is struggling with mental health, please contact the <a href=#>Crisis Text Line</a> by texting HOME to 741741, or call the <a href=#>National Alliance on Mental Illness Helpline</a> at 1-800-950-NAMI (6264).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamhga4V0hI6amKunnmKwor7TnqmsZZyes6Z5ya6qrWWkpLysecCnpq2glad6tK3DZquuqp5k</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
