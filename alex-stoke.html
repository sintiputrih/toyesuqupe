Alan Stokes, his identical twin, is barely 2 minutes younger. Stokes twins are half-white and half-Chinese. They are currently live in the Los Angeles area. Sheeba, the brothers’ childhood dog, was an Alaskan Malamute.</p><p>Alex’s mole near his right eye and Alan’s birthmark on his neck are the only ways to tell the twins apart. The majority of their acquaintances routinely confuse the two, and even their father has difficulties telling the difference. They’ve taken advantage of this in the past, misleading those around them and blaming each other. Alex is good friends with Okaymoe and Moe, both of whom are members of ‘Sunset Park.’</p><p>In terms of his family, his father is British-American, while his mother is Chinese. That is the main reason they resemble Chinese people. Furthermore, his grandfather’s name is Chen, and he used to live in China.</p><h2><span id=Body_Measurement>Body Measurement</span></h2><p><strong>This lovely and gorgeous individual stands out at 6 feet 1 inch tall. He also weighs about 75 kg.</strong> He’s built an athletic and powerful physique. <strong>As a result, his chest, waist, and arms are 38-30.5-12.5 inches. Furthermore, he wears a 12.5 shoe size (UK).</strong></p><p>As evidenced by his amazing figure and well-toned abs, he follows a strict gym regimen. His eyes are a gorgeous green, and he has dark brown hair.</p><h2><span id=Professional_Career>Professional Career</span></h2><p>Alan and Alex both began their careers in social media at the same time. They established the ‘Stokes Twins’ YouTube channel, which includes vlogs, challenges, personal updates, pranks, and Q&A videos. As a result, on April 11, 2008, they established the channel. The twin brother began working with Brent Rivera in 2017. They’re also famous for their TikTok short videos.</p><p>Their YouTube account was previously known as ‘alanalan9635.’ Their charisma and sense of humor drew a huge number of visitors to the channel soon after they began posting videos. A Q&A video is their most popular type of video on their channel. They’re also members of the ‘Sunset Park’ YouTube group.</p><p>The Stokes brothers have created a number of pranks and challenge videos in collaboration with other members of ‘Sunset Park.’ They took a year off from producing videos since they couldn’t come up with anything interesting to talk about. They co-founded their music label and website with other social media stars.</p><p>The label’s website, ‘heardwell.com,’ is a hybrid of a blog and an online store selling unique things. The Twin Brother attended the 2018 Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards with prominent skateboarder Ben Azelart. They strolled the red carpet without shirts underneath their coats. The incident became one of the highlights of the event.</p><p>They are currently managed by AMP Studios in the United States. Similarly, they made their acting debut in 2018. They appeared in both the science fiction TV show ‘Brobot’ and the family show ‘Afterschool.’ Alex played ‘Lukas’ in both series.</p><h2><span id=Net_Worth>Net Worth</span></h2><p>They are undoubtedly making a good living from their social media business.
