That being said, it turns out that, just the other day, Amanda Gorman was followed home and dubbed as ‘suspicious.’</p><p>While that is really shocking and distressing, it’s not an isolated, rare incident but rather the ‘reality of black girls.’</p><p>After reading a very powerful and inspiring poem at Joe Biden’s inauguration, Amanda Gorman has become an icon of the Black community and progressive youth in general.</p><p>However, even though she is someone who’s already done so much at 22, including signing a modelling contract with IMG Models, being interviewed by Michelle Obama herself, getting ready to publish three different books in 2021 – all of this after graduating cum laude from Harvard – she still gets racially profiled!</p><p>The activist took to her Twitter to describe what happened to her on March 5, writing that ‘A security guard tailed me on my walk home tonight. He asked if I lived there because I ‘look suspicious.’ I showed my keys and buzzed myself into my building. He left, no apology.’</p><p>She went on to point out why this was so much more than a simple misunderstanding: ‘This is the reality of all black girls: ‘One day you are called an icon, the next day, a threat. In a sense, he was right. I AM A THREAT: to injustice, to inequality, ignorance. Anyone who speaks the truth and then walks with hope is an obvious danger to the powers that be.’</p><p>The 22 year old icon received a lot of support from fans as well as celebrities.</p><p>Lily Collins, for instance, commented: ‘Keep being the constant light you are.’</p><p>Annasophia Robb wrote: ‘Who is this mf?! I wanna track him dowwwwwn!’</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Yamiche Alcindor, PBS White House correspondent also commented that: ‘Amanda Gorman’s experience is that of so many black people. Happy she made it home safely. So many others don’t.’</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeRoq6vsMBmnqiqnZa7brPErapmnp%2BhubDDxJ1koaedmnqjxYymmKdlk6GuqrnIp55mq5iaeq27zqSqZqulqL2qr8iorKxlo52ybr%2FAsqpmrJiewG610maroZ1dp7KiuMitsGanlmKvra3CpGSgoaKhwG6Al2lna2tf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
