While many of these items are offered at a low price, you can snag them for even cheaper (and with free shipping) if you purchase an <a href=#>Amazon Prime</a> membership.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Amazon Prime launched back in 2005 and began <a href=#>offering its customers incentives</a> if they elected to buy a membership. And if you recently noticed "Amazon Prime Pmts" posted on your credit card statement, it's because you agreed to become an Amazon Prime member. Here’s how much you should be paying for it and how to cancel your Amazon Prime membership.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-gIvpCV jBUmSX">Amazon Prime membership payments get charged to your credit card.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marketrealist.com/data:><p>When you sign up for Amazon Prime, you’re essentially agreeing to Amazon’s terms and conditions and recurring payments. These payments can be deducted from your credit or debit card monthly or once a year, depending on your preference. When you’re charged for an Amazon Prime membership, it might show up on your statement as “Amazon Prime Pmts.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In the past, Amazon was charging $12.99 per month for its Prime membership, or $119 annually. However, after Feb. 18, 2022, the e-commerce giant <a href=#>increased its pricing</a>. Below you’ll find a table that outlines Amazon’s new Prime membership pricing.</p><table><tr><th>Amazon Prime membership fee schedule</th><th>Monthly fee</th><th>Annual fee</th></tr><tbody readability=2><tr readability=2><td>Regular Prime membership holders</td><td>$14.99</td><td>$139.00</td></tr><tr><td>Students</td><td>$7.49</td><td>$69</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Government assistance recipients</td><td>$6.99</td><td>------</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Your Prime membership might also be subject to sales tax, which means the amount may be a bit higher than the fee schedule you see above. If you keep your Amazon Prime membership active, whether you use the benefits it offers or not, your <a href=#>credit card</a> will be charged monthly or annually.</p><p>Another reason you might be seeing “Amazon Prime Pmts” listed on your credit card statement could be because you enrolled in a Prime Video, Amazon Music Unlimited, or Kindle Unlimited subscription. The Prime Video membership costs $8.99 per month, while the Prime Music membership costs $7.99 per month or $79 per year.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>While it can be alarming to see "Amazon Prime Pmts" listed on your bank statement when you aren't a Prime member, you can always view payment details for any digital orders you placed from the "Digital Orders" tab under the "Orders" section of your Amazon dashboard.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-gIvpCV jBUmSX">Surprised by an Amazon Prime payment posted to your account?

It’s worth noting that Amazon will sometimes <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">place a pending charge</a> on your account for the full amount of your purchase to ensure the card isn’t lost or stolen. Once that charge drops off, you may then see various amounts posted to your account if you ordered more than one item.</p><p>Amazon will typically charge you for the items you purchase as they are shipped. Therefore, if you’re expecting multiple packages, you’ll see multiple charges on your credit card statement.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae4psDRnpiloaOpe6S7zGinaJmdlsewuoypqaKllWK9osXMnqWtq12Yv6awyK1knJmimXqktMCrnp5n</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
