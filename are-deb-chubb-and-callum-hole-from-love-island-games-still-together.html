In this cheeky new iteration, romance will meet reality as fan-favorite islanders are faced with both team and couples’ challenges, all while navigating dating, eliminations, recoupling, dramatic arrivals, and new competition twists and turns like never before.”</p><p data-characters=406 data-current-count=406 data-injectable=true>While dozens of contestants coupled up with someone from across the pond (like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Justine Ndiba and Jack Fowler</a>, <a href=#>Cely Vazquez and Eyal Booker</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lisa Celander and Curtis Pritchard</a>, and more), <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Callum Hole</a></strong> of Love Island: Australia tested the waters with a woman from Love Island: UK named <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Liberty Poole</a>, as well as a woman from Love Island: USA named <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Deb Chubb</a></strong>, during the inaugural season of Love Island Games.</p><p data-characters=340 data-current-count=340 data-injectable=false>Ever since day one in the villa, Callum found himself coupled up with the stunning Liberty Poole, however, the pair quickly realized that there was not a romantic spark between them, even after winning the iconic “Heart Rate Challenge” together, as well as spending a night in The Hideaway with one another — how wild is that?</p><p data-characters=563 data-current-count=903 data-injectable=true>After Liberty’s departure (which occurred after she lost a high-stakes duel to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jess Losurdo</a>), Callum found the romantic spark that he had been yearning for with the one and only Deb Chubb, who arrived as one of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">six bombshells</a> towards the very end of the competition. Coasting all the way to finale night, Callum and Deb came in third place (falling short to Justine Ndiba and Jack Fowler, as well as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Aurelia Lamprecht</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Johnny Middlebrooks</a>), but they got something soooo much more valuable that $100,000 — they found their perfect match in each other!</p><p data-characters=277 data-current-count=277 data-injectable=false>Given that Callum lives in Australia and Deb lives in the United States, is the pair still together and making long distance work? Keep scrolling to find out the relationship status of the two lovebirds, which Callum revealed in an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusive interview with The Messenger</a>…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Callum-and-Deb-Love-Island-Games.png><p data-characters=279 data-current-count=279 data-injectable=false>While Callum and Deb do not have the titles of boyfriend and girlfriend at the moment, “We’re just taking it as it comes… If it works out, it works out, but we’ve got no pressure on it,” the 25-year-old revealed to Charlotte Walsh at The Messenger.</p><p data-characters=380 data-current-count=659 data-injectable=true>He continued with a beaming smile, “She’s such a relaxed and chill person. We’ll just see what happens… I don’t think we’re gonna put any pressure on it. She did mention something about coming over here for New Years, so potentially we’d be linking up then. If not, definitely the new year when I head over to the States, for sure.”</p><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=282 data-injectable=false>Given that he is planning on spending some time in the United States in 2024, could a relationship between Callum and Deb actually come to fruition? Nonetheless, it is safe to say we will be keeping up with both islanders on Instagram to see where their connection goes from here…</p><p data-characters=233 data-current-count=515 data-injectable=false>To watch both Callum Hole and Deb Chubb on&nbsp;Love Island Games,&nbsp;fans of the&nbsp;Love Island&nbsp;franchise can&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">stream the entirety of the beloved competition series on Peacock</a>&nbsp;as we anxiously await a second season.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yivsRmm56aXZi1tq7BZpinnF2Yrq241KZkoaecmnqnvs6mZKWnppp6qr%2FLmqWdZZeWuqa%2FjKyroqScYsGws8Stn56qXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
