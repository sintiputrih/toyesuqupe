His sole Head of Household victory came in week 13 and instead of receiving a letter from his family, he got one from the 24-year-old bartender along with a photo of Reilly with his mom, further insinuating that there was chemistry to explore in the outside world.</p><p data-characters=149 data-current-count=149 data-injectable=false>While it was clear that Matt and Reilly had a budding romance inside the Big Brother house, fans now want to know what the real world holds for them.</p><h2 id=h-are-bb25-s-matt-and-reilly-dating-in-real-life data-injectable=false>Are BB25‘s Matt and Reilly dating in real life?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=449 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=224 data-current-count=224 data-injectable=false>As far as we know, Klotz and Smedley have not officially announced a romantic relationship despite host <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Julie Chen Moonves</a> mentioning during the live season finale that Matt was leaving the show with a girlfriend (awkward!).</p><p data-characters=393 data-current-count=617 data-injectable=true>Matt and Reilly were finally able to reunite after Jag Bains was crowned the winner of season 25. Matt, Jag’s “Minutemen” ally, sat beside him in the final two chairs, ultimately losing to a 5-2 vote. Despite this loss, Matt was awarded $75,000 for placing second, and now that he’s out of the house, he’ll be able to spend more time with his other prize: Reilly.</p><p data-characters=568 data-current-count=568 data-injectable=true>Matt, who lives in Louisiana, spoke with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Us Weekly</a> after the show wrapped, revealing what Reilly said to him on stage when they embraced for the first time in 84 days. “She whispered to me, ‘My parents moved to Georgia while I was in the B.B. house,’ so, she lives three hours from me. We live close now. After Reilly was evicted from season 25, she told the outlet that she thought “the world of Matt,” going on to say, “I went into this not wanting any sort of showmance. But, you know, I didn’t expect to meet someone like Matt.”</p><p data-characters=603 data-current-count=603 data-injectable=true>When Matt spoke with Entertainment Tonight host and Big Brother 24 winner <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor Hale</a> the day after the live finale, the 27-year-old Deaflympics gold medalist said he still had to speak with Reilly about their future, but he seemed optimistic. “We’ve definitely got to have our talks. You know, I haven’t seen her in a while. But, I’m excited. I was excited to see her when I got out of that house. I think it was really cool seeing that letter from her for HoH and a picture with my mom. And I was like, never thought that in a million years. So, that was a big surprise.”</p><p data-characters=98 data-current-count=98 data-injectable=false>Will Big Brother have joined <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">two more in matrimony</a> when all is said and done?
