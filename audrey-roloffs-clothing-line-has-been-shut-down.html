At the time, <a href=#><strong>Amy Roloff</strong></a> made it clear that she did not support his choice.</p><p>Earlier this year, her ex-husband made the controversial decision to put the property on the market.</p><p>“The BAD news, as you can imagine, is how difficult it was for me to put even 16 of the 108 acres of Roloff farm up for sale. ‘My ultimate hope was that the entire Roloff Farms property would stay in our family for generations to come,'” Matt penned in an Instagram update.</p><p>“Keeping that dream alive at this point in time was just not meant to be,” he continued. “Unfortunately, Roloff Farm farm cannot be legally divided into multiple parcels.”</p><h4 class="slide_title cpxi-italic-title"></h4><p>“My twin boys decided not to consider working together toward a possible joint sale. Both of them (along with their growing families) had moved on to other interests and investments…. and even tho a substantial family discount and a ‘gift of equity’ was offered by both Amy and I….(and I still owe Amy a bundle of money)” Matt continued. “They decided individually that the timing was not right for them to purchase a part of the farm at this time.”</p><p>Matt added, “Based on that, turning the big 60 in my cranky old body, the continuing maintenance/demands of the farm- the difficult decision was made so I could take steps toward my retirement goals.”</p><p>However, Amy and the rest of the family did not think that this was a necessary step.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Zach Roloff</strong></a> is clearly unhappy, and said as much in the comments.</p><p>“This post is extremely misguided and false,” he wrote. “My dad is manipulating the narrative right before the season comes out.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmusqpjsLC5jqBmmq2Up7K6edGoo6ielqh6pLjOrZ%2Bippdiuaq6xGafmqtdl7Kmuoysn66sXZm8uLqO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
