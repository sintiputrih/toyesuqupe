I have done that,” he exclusively told Us in December 2021. “Even going into the show, that was one of the conversations with the production company. … I’m not in a space right now to really, like, put myself out there like that. I had a lot of self-discovery to do.”</p><p>He added: “Having a public relationship, for me, was not healthy.

I’m sorry for any pain and emotional stress I caused. I wish that it wouldn’t have happened the way that it did.
