The song featured collaborations with Cardi B and J Balvin. The single quickly <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">rose to the top of the Billboard 100 charts</a> and introduced Bad Bunny to a larger audience in the United States. As a result of the song's success and his already-established career in Latin America, Bad Bunny's career skyrocketed.

This came as a surprise to fans as Bad Bunny was on a break from making music for a time. But, apparently, that time came to an end after 'Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va A Pasar Mañana (Nobody Knows What Will Happen Tomorrow)' was released on October 13, 2023. This new album has yet to affect Bad Bunny's net worth, but considering <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he made $88 million in 2022 alone</a>, according to 'Forbes' and still has a fortune of $40 million after living in the lap of luxury, it is expected that Bad Bunny will make that much, if not more when 2023 comes to a close, increasing his fortune substantially.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-karol-g-rsquo-s-net-worth><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>What Is Karol G’s Net Worth?</span></h2><h3 id=net-worth-25-million>Net Worth: $25 Million</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/karol-g-at-smirnoff-event.jpg><ul><li><strong>Colombian reggaeton singer/songwriter</strong></li><li><strong>Known for Ahora Me Llama, China, Tusa, and Mamiii</strong></li></ul><p>Karol G, a talented Colombian reggaeton singer and songwriter, boasts an impressive net worth of $25 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.
