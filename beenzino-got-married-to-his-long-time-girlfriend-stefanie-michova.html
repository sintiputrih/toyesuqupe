He requested everyone to make harsh comments in English instead of Korean when appearing on jTBC’s Witch Hunt in 2015, explaining that he had to translate them to Michova since she wanted to know them. He later went on KBS2’s Yoo Hee-Sketchbook yeol’s in 2016 and said that dating Michova transformed his personality, that it occurred during a period when he allowed fame to get to his ego, and that everything changed after meeting the latter.

He depicted Michova as a rustic girl, saying,</p><p>“I didn’t fall in love with Stefanie at first sight, but she was incredibly beautiful to me on our third trip together.” She is extremely straightforward. I went to New York with her once and was having a good time shopping when Stefanie burst out crying and said, ‘I don’t know anything and I don’t even enjoy it.’ Shopping is exhausting.’ I was really taken aback. “I learned that not everything about her was what I had assumed.”</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiZnp2er7avu4ygpq1lnZa%2Fs7XEnWStp12dtrR5y6iloGWknrqmecaiqaWeop6yr7CMrKuenpGjtqZ5zKKaoaemlnw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
