In later pieces we look at sub $220 models from Z77 and FM2, and another piece for our X79 picks.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/6894/Recommended_575px.png width=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><b>AnandTech Silver Award: ASUS Maximus V Formula (</b></a><b><a href=#>$290</a><a href=#> with AC3)</a></b></p><p>While the Formula doesn’t come cheap, and is in fact the most expensive Z77 motherboard without a PLX 8747 chip, it offers more of a package than any other non-PLX Z77 motherboard.&nbsp; The big draws are the SupremeFX IV audio solution, capable of reaching the Realtek listed dynamic range and THD+N numbers, the combination air/water VRM heatsink, and the package as a whole.&nbsp; In hardware we get an integrated WiFi/mPCIe combo card, an Intel NIC, extra SATA 6 Gbps, extra USB 3.0, options for overclockers and features such as BIOS Flashback.&nbsp; The BIOS is geared for overclocking, with our CPU sample hitting highs rarely seen internally on any other motherboard – the BIOS also includes plenty of OC features for high end memory kits.&nbsp; Software is similarly superb, with fan controls that actually act like fan controls should (see recent reviews for rants on this), network management, and features like USB 3.0 Boost. &nbsp;Users also have access to the vast ROG forums for help and hints to get the perfect system.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/6850/IMGP8832_678x452.JPG style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Read our review of the ASUS Maximus V Formula <a href=#>here</a>.</p><p><a href=#><b>AnandTech Silver Award: ASRock Z77 OC Formula (</b></a><b><a href=#>$225</a><a href=#>)</a></b></p><p>In a similar vein to the ASUS MVF, the ASRock Z77 OC Formula is a great motherboard to play with and is easily the best ASRock motherboard I have ever used.&nbsp; It dials in slightly cheaper than the ASUS (at the loss of some software control), but we still get plenty of overclock control, with the automatic options in the BIOS covering a wide range of clock speeds.&nbsp; This allows users to select the first option, stress test, then move to the next – stopping when stability is not to the user’s liking.&nbsp; The BIOS itself is so easy to use, and it looks a lot more polished than almost every other available on the market.&nbsp; Software gets an OC Formula skin, and the XFast combination (RAM, LAN, USB) can help improve performance.&nbsp; The ASRock has some benefits over the ASUS MVF – the ASRock has OC Touch buttons for that last competitive OC MHz and easier voltage check points.&nbsp; For regular use the ASRock has more SATA ports, more USB 3.0 ports, PCIe disable switches, six USB 3.0 on the rear, and in the box we get a front USB 3.0 panel and motherboard standoffs for out-of-the box setups.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/6894/ASRock%20Z77%20OC-F%20BoxBoard%20%20Oblique_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Read our review of the ASRock Z77 OC Formula <a href=#>here</a>.</p><p><a href=#><b>AnandTech Bronze Award: Gigabyte G1.Sniper 3 (</b></a><b><a href=#>$270</a><a href=#>)</a></b></p><p>Out of the PLX 8747 enabled motherboards we have tested on the Z77 platform, the Gigabyte G1.Sniper 3 has taken the lead in terms of layout, ease of user and performance.&nbsp; Even though users will probably not be running at stock, the G1.Sniper 3 uses MultiCore Turbo to improve stock performance of the CPU above every other motherboard we have tested.&nbsp; For gamers we have an Killer E2201-B network port alongside an Intel NIC, ten USB 3.0 ports, ten SATA ports, mSATA, PS/2 + Firewire connectivity, and a WiFi PCIe x1 card for users not using all the PCIe slots.&nbsp; There is a TPM as well as an eSATA rear bracket for additional options.&nbsp; While the PLX chip shows enhancements over non-PLX enabled three-way SLI/CFX and above, the option to have different PCIe layouts comes into force with PCIe SSDs or RAID cards.&nbsp; The Gigabyte G1.Sniper 3 still offers the best price/performance ratio for a PLX 8747 enabled board, and with better BIOS/software integration would have got a bigger award.&nbsp; This is something Gigabyte is working on for the future.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/6894/Gigabyte%20G1.Sniper%203%20Oblique%202_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Read our review of the Gigabyte G1.Sniper 3 <a href=#>here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#><b>AnandTech Silver Award: ASUS P8Z77-V Deluxe (</b></a><b><a href=#>$280</a><a href=#>)</a></b></p><p>Sweeping in at $280 is perhaps not the main price point for Z77, especially when there are motherboards that can run these processors for half the price.&nbsp; However, this is where the P8Z77-V excels - for your extra money, you get a plethora of enthusiast related features that a user would not dream of on a half-price product.&nbsp; Alongside the dual band WiFi, dual network controllers (one Intel, one Realtek), superior fan control and provision for a future Thunderbolt add-in card, we have the stalwarts of the ASUS arsenal, such as USB BIOS Flashback, Fan Xpert II, enhanced USB charging, USB 3.0 Boost, a well thought out BIOS and superior operating software. &nbsp;The only features directly missing seem to be those that add a significant cost on board (PCIe PLX chip for >2 GPUs, a premium sound solution), where instead we would normally see products specifically focused for them in that price bracket.&nbsp; As part of a long term, stable build, it is hard to put a foot wrong if you choose the P8Z77-V Deluxe.&nbsp;</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/6894/ASUS%20P8Z77-V%20Oblique_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Read our review of the ASUS P8Z77-V Deluxe <a href=#>here</a>.</p><p><b>What To Look Forward To</b></p><p>Haswell is approaching, and each of the contenders here will have a Z87 counterpart.&nbsp; Depending on the Z87 chipset itself, we may see more variation on how the motherboards line up, and whether each manufacturer will want to push up and down market segments.&nbsp; Regardless of what media coverage says regarding the shift to more mobile devices, the high end desktop space is still b – enthusiasts want more and they want it now. &nbsp;</p><p>As mentioned, our next ‘Best Motherboard’ feature will take a look at the $120-$200 market for both Z77 (regular + mITX) as well as an FM2 choice worth considering.&nbsp; While no new X79 products are hitting the shelves, we have tested a fair number of X79 and Sandy Bridge-E is still the way to go for a multi-core Intel machine – stay tuned for that roundup as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIN5hZNomZ6rpGK1qrPHZpynnF2vhHh5zKiroZ2il7yivsOsZJqoop65bn6Pamo%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy;
