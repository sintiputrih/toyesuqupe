A lot of the suggestions below feature extra pockets for items such as a mobile phone, a notebook or a diary, or even roomy enough for a makeup bag or your lunch box.</li><li><strong>How It Looks:&nbsp;</strong>This is an edit of stylish laptop bags, so we wanted to choose the most stylish out there. Whether that's the colour choice, the material or the shape, we want shoppers to feel chic and trendy en route to the office.</li><li><strong>Practicality:&nbsp;</strong>Ideally, a laptop bag has two handles - one small and one long. We know there are times when you need to carry your laptop around in different ways. It also needs to be compact enough to fit next to your feet on a busy commute or overhead on a train.</li><li><strong>Safety:&nbsp;</strong>Some internal pockets are useful, but making sure your laptop can't be pinched from its carrier is of utmost importance. We were on the hunt for laptop bags that have the option to conceal the contents inside.</li></ul><h2 dir=ltr>Why you should trust me&nbsp;</h2><p id=eewECU6RmRQt data-wc=98>I really wanted to do this feature when I found myself - post pandemic - having to commute from Leamington Spa to the <strong>HELLO!</strong> offices in London.

On the website there are lots of photographs showing how clever this laptop bag is. There are plenty of handy features; a back sleeve that slots over a suitcase handle (again, if you travel with a suitcase, it's so ideal), a full zip opener for easy packing and access, a zipped front pocket with card sleeve and key clip inside, a 16.5” laptop pocket, and an elasticated side pocket for a water bottle. I love the space for a water bottle, I do think this would be great if you cycle to work and you can hydrate on the go. Oh, and another great feature - inside the backpack, there’s a removable packing pocket for shoes or a change of clothes. Great if you want to store your running shoes or after-work gym kit in there.&nbsp;</p><a href=# class="buttonWidgetButton_b1lxbopb buttonClass_by57jsl -primary" rel="sponsored nofollow"><p>£140 AT ANTLER</p></a><a href=# class="buttonWidgetButton_b1lxbopb buttonClass_by57jsl -primary" rel="sponsored nofollow"><p>$58 AT ANTLER</p></a></li><li class=affiliateProductListItem_a15uc6c7><p class=affiliateProductIndex_a1sl6fga><span class=affiliateProductIndexCurrent_a17dh6lu>4</span><span class=affiliateProductIndexTotal_aangg2i>/18</span></p><h2 class="affiliateProductName_afobsy4 hm-heading">Stackers Laptop Bag</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/09d52ab4dbf4-stackers-laptop-bag-women.jpg><h3 class="affiliateProductName_afobsy4 hm-heading">Stackers Laptop Bag In Blush & Gold</h3><p class=affiliateProductListTitle_a1a518yz>Specifications</p><ul><li>Size: 12.4H x 2.6"D x 15.7"W</li><li>Primary Material: Faux leather and velvet</li><li>Space for a laptop (up to 15 inch)</li></ul><p dir=ltr>When I was on the hunt for my own laptop bag I couldn't decide if I wanted a rucksack or a tote bag. I know that rucksacks are brilliant - and perfect for distributing the weight on your body - but sometimes they don't quite work with your outfit. You can't wear a linen shirt or a linen blazer to the office and expect to look polished if you're all crinkled because of the rucksack you've been carting in. When I discovered the Stackers laptop bag, I knew I'd found the one. Talk about functionality! This can be worn as a backpack, handbag or a shoulder bag. It's so ideal. Keep reading to see why I think the Stackers laptop bag deserves to be at the top of this round up.</p><p dir=ltr>This bag is clever and has been well designed for a career woman. With space inside for your laptop (up to 16 inch), your phone, multiple pens, cables as well as a large zipped pocket, this bag is not only stylish but super practical. At the front there is a large zipped pocket for your charger, additional cables and accessories and a smaller zipped compartment at the back. The multi-wear laptop bag is made with a faux leather exterior and a soft velvet padded lining to ensure your laptop stays safe whilst on-the-go. I have the pink and I did worry it would look too babyish (I'm almost 40) but it's a very muted blush shade. I think the black might have been a better choice as my pink one limits what I can wear with it. I also think it's a very good price for how well made it is.<br></p><a href=# class="buttonWidgetButton_b1lxbopb buttonClass_by57jsl -primary" rel="sponsored nofollow"><p>£60 AT STACKERS</p></a></li><li class=affiliateProductListItem_a15uc6c7><p class=affiliateProductIndex_a1sl6fga><span class=affiliateProductIndexCurrent_a17dh6lu>5</span><span class=affiliateProductIndexTotal_aangg2i>/18</span></p><h2 class="affiliateProductName_afobsy4 hm-heading">AWAY The Everywhere Bag</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/77531735a36d-away-laptop-bag-women.jpg><h3 class="affiliateProductName_afobsy4 hm-heading">AWAY The Everywhere Bag In Navy</h3><p class=affiliateProductListTitle_a1a518yz>Specifications</p><ul><li>Size: 25.9cmH x 41.4cmW x 18.5cmD</li><li>Primary Material: Water-resistant nylon and leather trim</li><li>Fits up to 15" laptop</li><li>Colours available: Black, Navy, Coast</li></ul><p data-gid=es4PZl8_Lm dir=ltr>I'm a big fan of Away in general, and I have been ever since I tried my first Away suitcase.

Another positive point is that you can put this to the test and make sure it’s right for you and if you don't like it, you can return it anytime within the first 100 days of purchase.

When I think of trusted British bag brands I always think of Aspinal of London - one of Princess Kate's favourite bag brands - and this one looks perfect for the office (and beyond). Extremely elegant looking, the Zipped Regent Tote is the perfect companion for your work-to-weekend wardrobe. Handcrafted from full-grain leather, the semi-structured and lightweight design has a spacious interior with the capacity to hold a lightweight 14-inch laptop along with an open slip pocket for your valuables and two mobile slip pockets. I think this would suit a fashionista who likes a designer bag and wouldn't be seen dead wearing a £30 Amazon one. The best thing about this bag is the zip-top closure which will keep your belongings secure, while the long shoulder straps ensure all-day comfort for a trip to the office.</p><a href=# class="buttonWidgetButton_b1lxbopb buttonClass_by57jsl -primary" rel="sponsored nofollow"><p>£425 AT ASPINAL OF LONDON</p></a><a href=# class="buttonWidgetButton_b1lxbopb buttonClass_by57jsl -primary" rel="sponsored nofollow"><p>$525 AT ASPINAL OF LONDON</p></a></li><li class=affiliateProductListItem_a15uc6c7><p class=affiliateProductIndex_a1sl6fga><span class=affiliateProductIndexCurrent_a17dh6lu>10</span><span class=affiliateProductIndexTotal_aangg2i>/18</span></p><h2 class="affiliateProductName_afobsy4 hm-heading">Tory Burch Perry Triple-Compartment Tote Bag</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/880153897a94-tory-burch-laptop-bag.jpg><h3 class="affiliateProductName_afobsy4 hm-heading">Tory Burch Perry Triple-Compartment Tote Bag In Black</h3><p class=affiliateProductListTitle_a1a518yz>Specifications</p><ul><li>Size: 11.4"H x 14.2"L x 5.3"D</li><li>Primary Material: Leather</li><li>Fits up to 13" laptop</li></ul><p data-gid=e7hfOqpnMKCnr dir=ltr>Tory Burch's designer laptop bag is called the 'Perry tote' and it has pockets for organisation, longer straps that fit comfortably over the shoulder and extra room — with a centre zip compartment that fits a laptop.

The main area has separated compartments and pockets which can provide roomy space for your laptop (15.6inch) as well as your tablet, power bank, A4 files, wallet, and even clothes (I don't know about you but I often shove my heels in my laptop bag). It features an elastic pocket at each side so you can hold your umbrella or your water bottle. What's more, there's also a USB charging port extended on the side of the backpack and built-in charging cable inside.
