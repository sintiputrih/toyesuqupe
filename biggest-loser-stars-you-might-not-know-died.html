Even though she lost 117 pounds by the end of the season, Kramer later described how difficult it was to keep her weight at bay, per&nbsp;<a href=#>NorthJersey.com</a>.&nbsp;"I kept the weight off for about seven years," Kramer once said. "I kept it off by keeping my calorie intake at about 1,800 and working out two and a half hours a day. That did quite a number on my body. For me, it was a struggle the entire time. Maintenance was definitely the hardest part."</p><p>Unfortunately, <a href=#>Kramer died of a heart attack</a> at the age of 46 in July 2018. As an avid entertainer in the New York nightlife scene, she received tributes from her fellow performers. "RIP Poppi Kramer, 46, comedian, singer, loudmouth, dieter, kvetcher, Mets fan, Jewess, nightlife institution, friend," theater critic Adam Feldman, for example,&nbsp;<a href=#>tweeted</a>. "I thought she'd never leave. I can't believe she's gone."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamhjbYJ4fI6boKCflajBbrjOrJyrZaOprrO%2FjLKmrmWdnrSpwIynpq1lm6O8uHnDopydZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
