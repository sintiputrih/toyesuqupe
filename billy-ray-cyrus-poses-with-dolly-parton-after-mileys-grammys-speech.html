In the snap, he’s flanked by wife <strong>Firerose</strong> and Parton, 78.</p><p>Firerose shared the photo on her Instagram Story alongside a caption that read, “Beyond grateful for @dollyparton I will always love you.”</p><p>The post raised eyebrows for social media users since Parton is <a href=#><strong>Miley Cyrus</strong></a>’ godmother and there appears to be some discourse in the family regarding the “Flowers” singer and her father. (Billy Ray has been friends with Parton since the early 1990s.)</p><p>Miley, 31, accepted two <a href=#>Grammy Awards</a> earlier this month — she took home <a href=#>Best Pop Solo Performance</a> and Record of the Year for “Flowers” — and noticeably <a href=#>left her dad’s name out</a> of one acceptance speech.</p><p>“I don’t think I forgot anyone, but I might have forgotten underwear. Bye,” she said, after mentioning her musical collaborators, Tish and <strong>Brandi Cyrus</strong> and “love” <strong>Maxx Morando</strong>. Fans were quick to speculate that the <a href=#>Hannah Montana</a> alum was throwing subtle shade at her father as she doubled down by leaving her dad’s name <a href=#>out of an Instagram caption</a> post-show.</p><p>Miley’s parents, Billy Ray and Tish, 56, experienced various ups and downs throughout their marriage, which lasted <a href=#>from 1993 to 2022</a>. Tish recently revealed during a <a href=#>“Call Her Daddy” interview</a> earlier this month that there was a lot of “disrespect” in their marriage.</p><p>Tish quickly moved on with <strong>Dominic Purcell</strong>, whom she married in August 2023. Miley, Brandi and <strong>Trace Cyrus</strong> were present at the nuptials while <strong>Braison</strong> and <strong>Noah Cyrus</strong> appeared to <a href=#>skip the ceremony</a>, leading to rumors of a rift between the family. Billy Ray has since moved on with Firerose, who is 27 years his junior, and <a href=#>they tied the knot</a> in October 2023.</p><p>While Miley’s Grammys speech did not include a nod to her father, she offered Parton a shout-out in the <a href=# rel=noopener>aforementioned Instagram caption</a> following the awards ceremony.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“My godmother @dollyparton – I felt your fairy dust everywhere ( I put a little extra in my hair , could you tell?!)” Miley wrote.</p><p>Throughout her career, both Miley and Parton have been candid about their close-knit bond. Parton even told <a href=# rel=noopener>Us Weekly exclusively</a> in January 2022 that she strays from offering her goddaughter career advice.</p><p>“Everybody says, ‘Do you give Miley advice.’ I say, ‘Nobody gives Miley advice.’ She’s headstrong as I am but we both respect each other and we share things,” Parton said at the time. “If I feel like I’ve got something to say to her like a mother or an aunt or a godmother, I will say something or ask her a question about this or that or ask her a question even concerning my own career because I want to stay involved and important in the business for as long as I live.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaboZyhxm6%2BwLJknLGiqsBuvM6snKxlp57BqXnDqKOlsV2lrrPAzqdkmp6kmr9uucilnLKrXZy%2FornMsqpmq6CasqS0jg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
