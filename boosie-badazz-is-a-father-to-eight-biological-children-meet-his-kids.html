His daughters are Iviona Hatch, Ivy Ray Hatch, Tarlaysia Hatch, Lyric Hatch, and Toriana Hatch while his sons are Micheal Jordan Hatch, Torrence Taylor Hatch Jr., and Liara Jean.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Boosie Badazz, whose real name is Torrence Ivy Hatch Jr, had his children with different women, including Walnita Decuir Hatch, Trivia Weather Spoon, Tracey Taylor, and Gerlissa Haze. All of Boosie Badazz’s children look adorable and their mothers do not seem to be having trouble co-parenting with him. In their words on a reality show in 2014, ” He is the best dad to his kids”. As you wish to know all about Boosie Badazz’s children, this article talks intensively about them.</p><h2><b>Meet Boosie Badazz First Child, Iviona Hatch</b></h2><ul><li><span><strong>Date of Birth</strong>:&nbsp; December 4, 2001</span></li><li><span><strong>Age</strong>: 22 years old</span></li><li><span><strong>Mother</strong>: Walnita Decuir Hatch</span></li><li><span><strong>Occupation</strong>: Rapper and Instagram celebrity</span></li></ul><p><span>Iviona Hatch was born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana United States, on December 04, 2001. This makes her an American by nationality and of black ethnicity. She was raised alongside her three biological siblings namely; Toriana Hatch, Ivy Ray Hatch, and Micheal Jordan Hatch. </span><span>At the same time, she was also keeping a close relationship with her other five half-siblings which goes a long way to indicate that they are a closely knit family.</span></p><p><span>Although we believe she is educated, details about the celebrity kid’s educational background are not available for public consumption yet.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>Iviona Hatch Rose to Stardom at the Age of Ten as a Professional Rapper&nbsp;</b></h3><p>Iviona Hatch began rapping professionally in the year 2011, as that has been one of her hobbies since childhood. Her first single titled “Daughter of a King and Queen” was recorded after the arrest of her father on drugs and murder-related charges. Nevertheless, one might expect Iviona to have deteriorated after that ugly event happened to her father but that was not the case.</p><p>Ivonia, instead, made more songs that served as her way of hope, love, and support to her father while he was in prison. Some of her hit songs include London Ball, Savage Holidays, Go Off, Slept On, and many more. Till now, Iviona keeps dropping good songs to the admiration of her fans.</p><p>Besides the attraction Iviona has gained in her music career, her lifestyle can’t be unnoticed, right from her fashion sense to the way she behaves outside her career are all extraordinary. Currently, the rapper stands at a height 5 feet 4 inches. She also has adorable black eyes and black hair color.</p><h3><b>Boosie Badazz’s Daughter, Ivonia, is in an Intimate Relationship with a Girl&nbsp;</b></h3><p>In January 2023, Boosie Badazz’s daughter came out publicly for the first time with her girlfriend with whom she is in a relationship. However, this did not go down well with her father as rumors have it that he might be transphobic and homophobic following the comments he had made about lesbians.</p><p>He was criticized for the comment he made towards the American basketballer Dwyane Wade’s daughter, Zade Wade, for transforming her gender in February 2020 and also or going hard on Lil Nas X for being gay, as he did advise him to commit suicide. So, seeing that his own daughter is in a relationship with another female, questions are being asked now if he is going to be in support of her same sex relationship.</p><h3><b>Iviona Hatch’s Social Media Following</b></h3><p>The Instagram celebrity/influencer is not only known for her rap songs but also for her entertaining content about her lifestyle, family, and relationship across her different social media accounts. She currently has over a million followers on her Instagram and YouTube channels. She goes by the name <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Poison_Ivi</a> on YouTube and <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Poisonivi4x</a> on Instagram.</p><h3><b>Iviona Hatch’s Mum, Walnita Decuir Hatch, is an Author and Businesswoman</b></h3><p>Iviona’s mum, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Walnita Decuir Hatch</a> was born on March 15th, 1990. She was Boosie’s first baby mama but now his ex-fiance. She gained popularity after Iviona’s dad declared his intention to marry her. However, aside from all of what has to do with her relationship with the rapper, she is a prominent author and an entrepreneur with a cosmetic brand. She is the definition of a typical businesswoman!</p><p>However, before all of these beautiful accomplishments, Iviona’s mom was once arrested in 2010, on charges relating to the smuggling of illicit substances to Boosie in prison; these hard drugs are marijuana, codeine, and MDMA. Be that as it may, having known the fact that Boosie Badazz was once arrested for a drug and murder case, it is not surprising to have seen Decuir involved in such a case and other ugly incidents in the past.</p><h2><b>Tarlayasia Hatch is the Second Daughter and Child of Boosie Badazz&nbsp;</b></h2><ul><li><span><strong>Date of Birth</strong>: 15th September 2004</span></li><li><span><strong>Age</strong>: 19 years old&nbsp;</span></li><li><span><strong>Mother</strong>: Trivia Weather Spoon</span></li></ul><p>Tarlayasia Hatch, born by Trivia Weatherspoon in the year 2004 on the 15th day of September, is the second child of Boosie Badazz.

However, TY seemed to have been the only daughter of Boosie who celebrated his homecoming in a grand style. She took to an Instagram account to publicly sing and rap for her father.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>However, some fans castigated some of the words used by the then-five-year-old while composing the song, saying it wasn’t appropriate for a girl of that age to use the “N” word while others praised and commended her for the gesture.</span></p><h3><b>Tarlayasia Hatch and Her Mum Appeared on a Reality Show in 2014</b></h3><p>Trivia Weatherspoon, Tori’s mum, is the second baby mama of Boosie Badazz.
