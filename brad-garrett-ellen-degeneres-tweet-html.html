The talk-show host recently responded to allegations of racism and mistreatment <a href=#>by current and former employees</a> of her daytime talk show by <a href=#>issuing an apology to her staff</a> who had been “treated unfairly, not equal — or worse — disregarded.” In the letter, which was <a href=#>obtained by The Hollywood Reporter this week</a>, DeGeneres put most of the blame for the allegations on the show’s producers, who she said “are speaking on my behalf and misrepresenting who I am and that has to stop.” But one person read DeGeneres’s apology and decided to call her out on her blame-shifting: Everybody Loves Raymond alum Brad Garrett. Just after midnight on July 31, the actor <a href=#>responded to the news of DeGeneres’s apology</a> on Twitter by writing, “Sorry but it comes from the top ⁦@TheEllenShow Know more than one who were treated horribly by her.⁩ Common knowledge.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Sorry but it comes from the top ⁦<a href=#>@TheEllenShow</a> Know more than one who were treated horribly by her.⁩ Common knowledge.

At the center of the allegations are head writer and executive producer Kevin Leman, executive producer Ed Glavin, and co-executive producer Jonathan Norman. According to two sources who <a href=#>spoke to THR</a> prior to the new allegations, Glavin will reportedly be one of the staffers fired as a result of <a href=#>WarnerMedia’s ongoing investigation</a> of the show, which was prompted by <a href=#>BuzzFeed News’ original report published on July 16</a>. In BuzzFeed’s latest report, five former employees accused Glavin of touching them inappropriately, and dozens of others said he had a reputation for “being handsy with women.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckdbwvkdp000s3g646doshp9m@published data-word-count=51><strong>Update, August 1: </strong>Actress and director Lea Thompson has chimed in on Twitter to support Brad Garrett’s comments.
