Activist Wiki</h2><p><strong>Brenda Tracy</strong> was raped by four college football players in a violent gang rape in 1998. She went to the hospital, made a police complaint, and prayed that justice would be served soon. Unfortunately, as in so many of similar situations, this did not occur. Despite officers accumulating a mountain of evidence, including confessions from her assailants, the district attorney refused to prosecute her. She was not informed of her victims’ rights when authorities destroyed her evidence three years before the statute of limitations. Her actual age has not been confirmed, however she might be in her forties.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Brenda-Tracy-1.jpg alt="Brenda Tracy" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>Brenda went on with her life while suffering with the horrible incident alone, while her perpetrators went free.&nbsp;She eventually found the courage to come out publicly in 2014, and she is now fighting to make the world a better place for survivors. Brenda has always advocated for legislation on behalf of victims.&nbsp;She started the nonprofit organization Set The Expectation to engage and encourage men to become changemakers in their communities.&nbsp;Through her addresses to audiences around the country, she fosters a societal change to prevent sexual abuse. When it comes to Brenda Tracy, she has yet to be listed in Wikipedia.</p><h2>Brenda Tracy’s Son Darius: Who Is He?</h2><p>Tracy gave birth to her oldest son, <strong>Darius Adams</strong>, when she was 18 years old. Darius was five years old and his younger brother Devante was four years old when their mother was sexually abused.&nbsp;Tracy was dating a guy who had just graduated from Oregon State. Despite their subsequent split, he supported her throughout the process.&nbsp;Darius and Devante’s parents split when they were children owing to their father’s drug and alcohol problems.</p><p>For the most of his life, Darius suffered with suicidal thoughts, drug and alcohol abuse, and unreasonable animosity of his mother.&nbsp;Tracy tried to help her son, who had already dropped out of high school. She didn’t tell Darius about her sexual assault or his father’s abuse until he was 17 years old.&nbsp;His mother’s story motivated him to make a positive shift in his life. Darius worked hard in school before joining the basketball team. He continued to play basketball throughout college.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Brenda-Tracy-2.jpg alt="Brenda Tracy" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Darius and Devante, like their mother, are active members of the community. They co-founded the Change.org petition to implement the NCAA’s sexual assault policy.&nbsp;<strong>Mike Riley</strong>, the head coach of the team at the time, only issued a one-game suspension to two of the players who had sexually attacked her. The coach characterized their actions as a “bad choice.”&nbsp;Riley apologized to Tracy after The Oregonian published an article in 2014 that pushed Tracy’s tale into the public debate about sexual assault on college campuses.</p><p>He stated that he was unaware of all the details of what his players had done, therefore he only punished them lightly. Tracy, on the other hand, welcomed his heartfelt apologies.&nbsp;After transferring from Oregon State to the University of Nebraska, she was invited to address his players.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiZq52ema5uwNGamrJlp564qnnHqK5mp5yZeqq%2FjKyfnmWUlr%2BqwdJmmJ2Znah6rrvToZyrZZGcsm6ywKagpbFdmbK1rcilqmg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
