His family relocated frequently during his childhood, settling in Eureka, California, Seattle, Washington, Ottawa, Ontario, the Netherlands, and Switzerland.</strong></p><p>He attended Upper Canada College, a Toronto boarding school. During a vacation in London, England, he attended his first professional theater production in the West End, which piqued his interest in acting.</p><p>He graduated from Cornish College of the Arts in Seattle in 1990. He began his acting career in New York City at a small acting school. He had planned to pursue a Master of Fine Arts in Acting at Southern Methodist University, but he changed his mind in Hollywood and decided to stay and work in film.</p><p>In Dogfight, Fraser made his film debut as a Seaman on his way to Vietnam in 1991. In the 1992 comedy film Encino Man, he played a frozen pre-historic caveman who is thawed out in the present day, which was his first leading role.</p><p>The film did well at the box office. That same year, he co-starred in School Ties with Matt Damon and Chris O’Donnell.</p><p>In 1994, he played Steve Nebraska in The Scout and Montgomery “Monty” Kessler in With Honors, and he co-starred in Airheads with Adam Sandler and Steve Buscemi. All three films were box office duds.</p><p>He appeared in films such as The Passion of Darkly Noon and The Twilight of the Golds, both directed by Philip Ridley.</p><p>He had his first major box office success with the 1997 comedy film George of the Jungle, which was based on Jay Ward’s animated series of the same name.</p><p>He won acclaim for his dramatic performance in Gods and Monsters, a 1998 film based on the life of James Whale (Ian McKellen), the director of Frankenstein.</p><p>Bill Condon wrote and directed the film, which follows the loss of creativity, ambiguous sexuality, and the bond between a heterosexual gardener (Fraser) and a homosexual, tortured, and ailing filmmaker (played by McKellen).</p><p>His biggest commercial success came when he starred as Rick O’Connell in The Mummy and its sequel The Mummy Returns.</p><p>Between these successes, he appeared in the box office flops Dudley Do-Right and Monkeybone, though he did have moderate success with the 1999 romantic comedy Blast from the Past and the 2000 fantasy comedy Bedazzled, a remake of the 1967 British film of the same name.</p><p>He co-starred in the unreleased animated film Big Bug Man with Marlon Brando.</p><p>In 2002, he co-starred with Michael Caine in the political drama The Quiet American, which received positive reviews from critics. The following year, he played D.J. Drake in the live-action/animated film Looney Tunes: Back in Action (he also voiced the Tasmanian Devil). He was a member of the ensemble cast in the Academy Award-winning film Crash in 2004.</p><p>Fraser is fluent in French and serves on the FilmAid International board of directors. He is an accomplished amateur photographer who has used several instant cameras in films and television shows, most notably in his Scrubs guest appearances.</p><p>In his first appearance, he used a Polaroid pack film, and in his second appearance, he used a Japanese-only Holga with a Polaroid back.</p><p>Fraser is mentioned in the book Collector’s Guide to Instant Cameras. He is also a skilled amateur archer.</p><p>In 2018, Fraser claimed that he was sexually assaulted at a luncheon in 2003 by Philip Berk, then-president of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), the nonprofit organization that votes for the Golden Globe Awards.</p><p>Fraser’s depression was exacerbated by the alleged assault, his subsequent divorce, and the death of his mother, which, combined with his health issues, forced him to take a break from his career.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Brendan Fraser Children: Meet Griffin, Leland, and Holden</h2><p>Brendan Fraser has three (3) children with his ex-wife, Afton Smith. Griffin Arthur Fraser, their first child, was born on September 17, 2002.</p><p>Holden Fletcher Fraser, their second child, was born on August 16, 2004, and Leland Francis Fraser, their third child, was born on May 2, 2006, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jpupnqaUlrtustGaqp6qXZi1qrjDq5ynZZentqeyyKdkpZ2clruleceoo52dnmQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
