The actress was as candid as possible in her first ever video on the platform, opening up about her struggle with social anxiety among other topics.</p><p><a href=#>The Marvel star</a>’s first clip on YouTube is titled ‘So, I made a decision…’ making reference to her choice to start the channel in the first place.</p><p>Furthermore, the clip actually featured more than just <a href=#>Brie</a>, the actress being joined by other YouTube stars in addition to her grandma and mother, all trying their best to give her great pieces of advice about how to thrive on the content creating app.</p><p>As she starts the video, Larson introduces herself, struggling to get it right a couple of times.</p><p>The celeb goes on to explain to her viewers the reason why she’s decided to create a channel: ‘YouTube has been a place I have learned so much. Whether it has been how to use my printer, or it has been watching how to be a considerate activist. This is the place to talk about important things that matter. It does not mean that there is not also silly content, that there are ways for me to express myself. But, there will be deep conversations as well, anti-racist rhetoric and inclusive content.’</p><p><a href=#>Brie</a> then states that this first video was just her getting a feel of what it’s like to do this kind of thing and also chatting with some ‘brilliant creators.’</p><p></p><p>As mentioned before, she also gets candid about having social anxiety and being an introvert.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>‘For me, my baseline has been, I’m an introvert with asthma. Like, that’s been my story for myself…I’m introverted, I’m scared, I have social anxiety. And through, in particular, playing Captain Marvel, that like kind of wiped clean those titles I had for myself and made me go, ‘Woah, I’m not really that anymore.’ And so, from there I found that speaking out, telling my story, talking about things that I’m scared of, has just helped me so much.’</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeSp7amecuaqaynnmK0psDSZpqappSesW6twaisrWWjqb%2B2s8aloKefXay2tbSMrKacoZGheqK616KcrbFdpLtutMSrZKedp2LGsMHTrpmeZZOdrq%2B6xKVkbWliaIR0ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
