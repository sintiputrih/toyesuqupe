Us Weekly receives compensation for this article as well as for purchases made when you click on a link and buy something below. <a href=# rel><i>Learn more!</i></a></p><p>What’s the most generic interest we can add to our dating profile? “Long walks on the beach,” of course. It’s corny and unimaginative, but we have to admit . . . it’s true! Especially when we have an ultra-comfortable pair of <a href=# data-link=1>sandals</a> to wear!</p><p>Which sandals, though? The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Birkenstock Arizona</a>, of course. That’s what <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Britney Spears</strong></a> just wore on her own long walk on the beach with boyfriend<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> <strong>Sam Asghari</strong></a>, whom she met on the set of her “Slumber Party” music video a few years ago. The two enjoyed some fun in the sun on vacation in Miami, and while we were so jealous of the trip itself, we’re eyeing these Birks the most!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Birkenstock-Arizona.jpg><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Birkenstock Arizona sandal</a> for just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">$99.95</a> at Zappos!</strong></p><p>These sandals have nearly 200 reviews, with an overwhelming majority at a perfect five stars. One shopper called these shoes their feet’s “happy place,” unable to get over the extreme comfort factor. Another said it’s “like having your footprint there waiting for you” when stepping into these Birkenstocks because they mold to our feet so well!</p><p>Others commented on the white shade, noting how it “elevates” the shoes and how it’s a “nice, bright white” unlike other shoes that claim to be white and are actually cream. That must be part of why shoppers are receiving “compliments on them all the time”! All the time is going to be a long time, by the way, because these shoes “last forever!”</p><p>When Spears wore <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">these shoes</a>, she paired them with a hot pink bikini top and black bottoms, layering with a sheer plaid coverup. The casual beach look was super cute, and seeing those sandals, all we can think is “gimme more,” which is soon going to turn into an “Oops, I did it again” as yet another pair of Birkenstocks ends up on our doorstep! No regrets.</p><p>These sandals have a Birko-Flor upper, which was developed by Birkenstock as a more affordable alternative to leather that’s smooth, durable and easy to clean. There are two wide straps that cross our foot in classic Birkenstock fashion, with silvertone buckles that we can adjust for a custom fit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Britney-Spears-on-Beach.jpg><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Birkenstock Arizona sandal</a> for just<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"> $99.95</a> at Zappos!</strong></p><p>Speaking of custom fits, the footbed of this shoe is leather-lined and contoured, made to mold to our foot as we wear it. It will fit our foot, and only our foot, precisely!</p><p>The footbed also features a raised toe bar, which is “designed to encourage the natural gripping motion of your feet, exercising your legs and aiding circulation.” Easiest workout ever? There’s also a neutral heel profile and deep heel cup to keep our foot in place and help evenly distribute our body weight. Who knew shoes could do so much more than just look cute? Our standards have been raised!</p><p>The EVA outsole is white to match the upper. It’s flexible and lightweight, but still works hard to absorb shocks from the uneven ground and provide traction to keep us from slipping!</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">These sandals</a> actually wick away moisture, so don’t worry about preserving them on potentially sweaty summer days. Plus, Birks are made specifically so they can be repaired, resoled or completely renewed with ease, so once we find our favorite pair, we can keep it forever!</p><p>We’re feeling so “lucky” to have spotted these on Spears, and even luckier that we’ll soon be spotting them right on our own feet!</p><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Birkenstock Arizona sandal</a> for just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">$99.95</a> at Zappos!</strong></p><p><strong>Not your style?
