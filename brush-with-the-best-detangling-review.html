But there are times when traditional brushes, and even combs, can pull or tug at the hair and thus lead to breakage.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, celebrity hairstylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Felicia Leatherwood</a> developed the appropriately named Brush With the Best Detangler Brush that solves all of these problems and makes wash day a breeze. Simply put, it's the best hair brush to prevent breakage.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I've been using this tool for about two years and have noticed a serious reduction in shedding ever since. It's all thanks to the brush's innovative flexi-bristles, which spread apart as you move down the hair shaft — and lessen the strain put on strands as a result.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Brush with the Best</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>To shop: </strong>$18; <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow">amazon.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I love to use this brush during the styling portion of my wash day. Not only for the obvious reasons, but I find that it does a great job of making sure my hair is properly coated in product, and also helps to define and clump my curls.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To use, I simply section out my hair, spritz on some water, then layer an oil and leave-in. Next, starting at the ends, I gently brush out my hair and work my way up to the roots. It typically only takes me a few seconds to get through each section.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: The Best Hot Oil Treatments You Didn't Know Your Natural Hair Needed</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There's no denying that there are now a ton of detangling brushes out on the market (including knockoffs of Leatherwood's own), and I've tested many of them. But this tool, in particular, has earned both its title of Brush With the Best, as well as a consistent spot in my hair routine — and it won't be going anywhere.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This is All Natural.
