"I haven’t talked to her in seven years. I haven’t talked to her since February of 2010, that’s the last time I had a conversation with her," he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> magazine. "I had a conversation with her husband [Kevin Hunter], but it wasn’t nothing productive —&nbsp;just a bunch of yelling and screaming."</p><p>So, what happened between Charlamagne and Wendy (and Kevin)?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The Charlamagne and Wendy Williams beef explained:&nbsp;</h2><p>In his best-selling book Black Privilege, Charlamagne claimed he was fired from Wendy's radio show in 2008, but it wasn't due to downsizing, as was initially claimed.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>He accused Kevin of letting him go because of a bad business deal.</p><p>"He was always extremely aggressive in trying to get more money out of situations,” he wrote, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BET</a>.

Charlamagne made references to Brown's family's history of murder and domestic abuse.

(Salute to Kwame Brown) After all the talk I think it's time to share some real scary truths about an individual y'all really still [know] nothing about. And definitely time to clear up the lies. Truth is powerful, and there is only one true God. I regret the day I ever brought you around any of my people."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>He continued, "My ex been told me you was a piece of s--t, and I mean early. I was like, 'Nah this lil dude like my brother.' Treated him like family, [opened] my home, let [him] live rent-free, got [him] his first job and salary next to the queen of New York radio in the No. 1. market only for this f--kboy to act like an unappreciative piece of s--t.
