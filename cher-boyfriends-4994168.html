At the age of 16, Cher moved to Los Angeles to follow her dreams and ended up meeting Sonny, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>. &nbsp;“I was with my girlfriend, who was really beautiful. He liked her so he didn’t really say anything to me. He was like, ‘Oh yeah, kid,’” Cher said on her podcast in 2018, per the outlet. However, they soon became friends, singing partners and eventually lovers, getting hitched in 1964 in Tijuana.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>They also became pop stars together, with the release of their single “I Got You Babe” reaching number one in 1965. Then they went on to have their own successful TV career, hosting the very successful Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>By 1975 the romance had sputtered, and the couple officially divorced. “We had a weird relationship. I don’t expect anybody to understand it,” Cher said of her romance with Sonny to<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Mail On Sunday </a>in 2018. In 1998, Sonny died in a tragic skiing accident in Lake Tahoe.</p><h2>Tom Cruise</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Cher-Relationship-History-SS-embed-5.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Cher and<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong> Tom Cruise</strong></a> dated briefly in the 80s. According to the star, she met Tom in 1985 at Sean Penn and Madonna’s wedding, per the Mail On Sunday. She then met up with her again at the White House. “A bunch of people who were dyslexic were invited to the White House, and Tom and I are both dyslexic,” she explained. “We didn’t go out till way later, but there definitely was a connection there.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>While they did eventually go on some dates, it was never a long-term thing. However, according to the star, they are still friends to this day. “Though I don’t get what he does, that whole Scientology thing. I can’t understand it so I just… don’t.” she said.</p><h2>Val Kilmer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Cher-Relationship-History-SS-embed-6.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>Before Tom, Cher dated his <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Top Gun&nbsp;co-star,</a>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Val Kilmer</strong></a>, from 1982 to 1984.

I saw too many people where it ruined their lives. It ruined Gregory’s life.”</p><h2>Gene Simmons</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Cher-Relationship-History-SS-embed-4.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-11>As for <strong>KISS</strong> rocker <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Gene Simmons</strong></a>, who she dated from 1977 to 1980, Cher said he’s “the one I’m crazy about.

She admitted that the 40-year age gap between them is “ridiculous” on an episode of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Kelly Clarkson Show.</a> “Well, on paper it’s kind of ridiculous. But in real life we get along great. He’s fabulous and I don’t give men qualities that they don’t deserve,” she smiled. “He’s very kind, he’s very smart, he’s very talented and he’s really funny and I think he’s quite handsome,” she continued. Sadly the duo is no more as of May 1, 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8KhnKtlkqTGp77InqWdq11phnqAkG9vaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
