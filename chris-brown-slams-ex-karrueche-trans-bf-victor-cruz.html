Retired wrestler spanks [sic]. I’M F—KING AROUND … Good [sic] bless.”</p><p>The Grammy winner didn’t leave things at that, however, adding in two separate subsequent comments, “No shade” and “Just minor.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Chris-Brown-Slams-Karrueche-Tran-Boyfriend-Victor-Cruz-Clothing-Style.jpg><p>In fact, Brown offered to help Cruz improve his fashion game. “Nothing bad or major,” he wrote. “<a href=#>UPGRADE HIM SIS</a>. I’ll take him around to style him. NOT HATE. He just need some game spirit.”</p><p>He concluded, “Peace love and joy. JUST PLEASE UPGRADE YA [sic] MAN BOO.”</p><p>Brown’s Instagram Stories revealed that the musician may have had some ulterior motives for his suggestion, however. “Is it a sucka [sic] move to think about your ex?” he captioned one.</p><p>Read another, “A person that you really care bout [sic] you gone [sic] show it … even on bad terms.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Chris-Brown-Instagram.jpg><p>It’s not the first time Brown has offered his two cents on the couple: In March 2018, he commented that his former flame looked “<a href=#>really good</a>” with the wide receiver.</p><p>Brown and Tran, 31, who dated on and off from 2011, <a href=#>split in December 2014</a>. “I refuse to be repeatedly mistreated especially by someone who claims to love me,” she wrote at the time. “That’s not love. … If you can’t love me the right way, then don’t love me at all. Don’t be mad at me because I prefer to be happy.”</p><p>The rapper hurled his own accusations at the actress at the time, responding, “We’ve got scars, some of them u [sic] gave me, some of them I’ve caused. That ride or die act we have been fooling the world with obviously ain’t working. I was locked up for damn near 4 months and only got 1 visit from you while u [sic] was hosting parties and taking secret trips to Toronto, going on dates with <a href=#><strong>Drake</strong></a>!”</p><p>Tran <a href=#>served her ex with a restraining order</a> over allegations of physical abuse in May 2017. The order was later extended through June 2022, though <a href=#>Tran reportedly made amendments</a> to the paperwork that would allow the duo to attend the same industry events in December 2017, according to The Blast.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Chris-Brown-Slams-Karrueche-Tran-Boyfriend-Victor-Cruz-Clothing-Style-05.jpg><p>That same month, Tran <a href=#>began dating Cruz</a>, 32.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“<a href=#>Karrueche feels supported by him</a> and thinks they are the real deal,” the source told Us of the duo in December 2018. “She’s very into him and he feels strongly about her too.”</p><p>Brown, meanwhile, remains single, though an insider told Us Weekly in November 2018 that he also remains <a href=#>in “frequent contact</a>” with ex <a href=#><strong>Rihanna</strong></a>. The “Undecided” crooner most recently commented on the Fenty designer’s lingerie-clad photo in May. “<a href=#>TO BREAK DA INTERNET!</a> KEEP RISING QUEEN,” he wrote. “MUSIC SOON PLEASE.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacoKKewG6u0aiup2Wjoa6uv4yer2ajkae%2FtrHCoZxmrKKWu7R5wZ9kr6GTqbyzecKrrLNn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
