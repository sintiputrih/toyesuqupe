It just didn’t blend. That’s bound to happen after 18 [years] and dozens of people. You get along with some better than others.”</p><p>The TV host has spoken out about Charlie before. “Charlie and I, he was just East Coast, me, Southern kid, it <a href=#>was like oil and water</a>,” he explained on Live With Kelly in 2017. “We just didn’t get along.”</p><p>Harrison isn’t afraid to poke fun at the Bachelor and Bachelorette leads — though he told Us on Sunday that he didn’t shade 18th Bachelor <a href=#><strong>Juan Pablo Galavis</strong></a> “as much as he shaded himself.”</p><p>“The actual person is all I care about,” he observed. “As long as we’re good that’s fine. … No one ever called and said, ‘Hey, you hurt my feelings.’ That’s not bad. That’s pretty good. I’m also open about keeping an open dialogue with everyone I love and adore and I would never say anything in just unless I knew they could take it.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Chris-Harrison-Names-Bachelor-He-Had-Hard-Time-Getting-Along-With-01.jpg><p>Harrison had high praise for the current Bachelor, pilot <a href=#><strong>Peter Weber</strong></a>. “He’s that guy that the show is based on,” the host told Us. “He’s the guy that seemingly has everything. Good looking, good career, sweet, he has this amazing family. He just hasn’t fallen in love yet.”</p><p>The Bachelor airs on ABC Mondays at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p>With reporting by Tatiana Steelman</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJqhqpmoeqmt0augrKeeYq%2Bir8eeo6iqXZi1or7Lopxmp5Oku6%2Bxy6VksJmjYrWivsNmq6hll5rBbq3LqKWgZaeewal7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
