He’s been active online since 2012, and all of his efforts have helped put his net worth to where it is today.</p><p>How rich is Cole LaBrant? As of late-2017, sources estimate a net worth that is at $2.5 million, mostly earned through success in his various online endeavors. He earns large amounts of money through his content on Vine, and is also a part of the collaboration group called “Dem White Boyz”. As he continues his efforts, it is expected that his wealth will also continue to increase.</p><h3>Cole LaBrant Net Worth $2.5 million</h3><p>Growing up, Cole and his friends found that many people had been finding success online through the website Vine, so they decided to join the social media platform as the collaborative group “Dem White Boyz”, consisting of Cole, Baylor Barnes and John Stephen Grice. Soon, their videos started gaining a lot of popularity, increasing their net worth significantly. The high follower count also opened up many opportunities for them to increase their net worth, and in 2013 they were given a sponsorship contract with the company Water Bluff Clothing; Cole also signed with the company as a model. He then decided to expand his reach to other social media networks, and started a YouTube channel which he runs alongside his brother, although it hasn’t had quite the same success as Vine. Despite that, the channel’s subscriber count also increased, with some of his most popular uploads on his channel being “Prom with Selena Gomez”, “Gody Dating Advice from College Guy”, and “Blair Fowler Does My Makeup”. He found more popularity creating a musical.ly account under the name “thesupercole” which has quickly amassed over four million fans.</p><p>Labrant continued to raise his net worth in the next few years, as he also started doing acting projects. In 2013 he became a part of the television series called “Sanders Shorts”, which focuses on a variety of sketches and pranks. He also had an animated television series project released two years later called “Sadie and Emmie”, which went on to run for 40 episodes over three seasons.</p><p>In 2016, he actually competed alongside his mother, in the highly popular reality TV show “The Amazing Race” during its 28th season; the series is focused on a race around the world for a grand prize of $1 million. Labrant and his mother competed very well and found themselves reaching the final episode, to eventually finish second, beaten by the engaged dancers Dana and Matt, still a very significant achievement. His net worth increased even further thanks to this and the numerous other achievements he’s delivered.</p><p>For his personal life, it is known that Cole married <a href=#>Savannah Soutas</a> in 2017 and they have a daughter. He has also started a YouTube channel with his wife called “Cole&Sav”.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjpympZ1doa6jvsCnq2amlal6uLvRrZ9o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
