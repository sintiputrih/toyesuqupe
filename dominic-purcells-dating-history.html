Purcell then had an on-off relationship with actress <a href=#><strong>AnnaLynne McCord</strong></a>, who is 17 years younger than him, lasting nearly a decade.</p><p>At the beginning of their romance, Purcell <a href=#>exclusively told Us Weekly</a> in September 2011 that McCord was “one of the most intelligent women I’ve ever met in my life.” He joked, “She doesn’t take any of my s–t, which I need.”</p><p>When Purcell began dating Cyrus in 2022, <a href=#>who has since become his wife</a>, he was equally as enamored by her personality.</p><p>“Punching way above my weight — yep absolutely,” Purcell <a href=# rel=noopener>wrote via Instagram</a> in April 2023. “I’m a lucky bastard. She’s the best human ever. Love ya love @tishcyrus.”</p><p>Scroll down to see all of Purcell’s suitors, past and present:</p><h3><strong>Rebecca Williamson</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Dominic-Purcell-Dating-History-2.jpg><p>The Prison Break alum was married to Williamson from <a href=# rel=noopener>1998 to 2007</a>. Their divorce was finalized the following year. Purcell and Williamson share four children: daughters Lily and Audrey and sons Augustus and Joseph.</p><h3><strong>AnnaLynne McCord</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Dominic-Purcell-Dating-History-1.jpg><p>McCord and Purcell met while filming Officer Down. They <a href=# rel=noopener>went public with their romance</a> in July 2011. “We have healthy debates, which I absolutely love,” McCord exclusively told Us in September 2011. “At the very end of the conversation we will both go, ‘I respect your opinion. I disagree with you. But I respect your opinion because I love you.'”</p><p>The twosome split in 2014 after dating three years but got back together in 2016. The 90210 actress and Purcell briefly broke up again in 2018 before rekindling their romance in 2020. McCord and Purcell’s relationship fizzled out for good by summer 2021.</p><h3><strong>Noah Cyrus</strong></h3><p class=p1>Purcell was linked to Noah before her mom, <strong>Tish Cyrus</strong>, started seeing him in 2022.</p><p class=p1>“Noah was [seeing] Dominic when Tish started pursuing him,” a source <a href=#><span class=s1>exclusively told Us Weekly</span></a> in February 2024. “Noah is very distraught over Tish stealing Dominic from her.</p><p class=p1>Neither Noah, Tish nor Purcell have publicly addressed the claims.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><h3><strong>Tish Cyrus</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/tish-cyrus-says-dominic-purcell-went-from-hall-pass-to-husband-02.jpg><p>Tish started dating Purcell after <a href=#>she filed for divorce</a> from <strong>Billy Ray Cyrus</strong> in April 2022. However, the pair first crossed paths in 2016 when <a href=#>Purcell DM’d Tish</a>, writing, “Hey Tish, just wanted to [say], I think you’re super cool and … you’re doing such a great job with your family.”</p><p>Tish didn’t see the message until 2017, when she realized she had been blocked by the actor. “[His] ex had seen he hit me up and blocked me from his Instagram,” Tish explained during a February 2024 appearance on the “Call Her Daddy” podcast. “I almost peed my pants because I was like … Why am I blocked? He doesn’t even know I exist, and I’m blocked.”</p><p>Once she had split from Billy Ray, Tish looked Purcell back up on Instagram and realized she was no longer blocked. She proceeded to message him and the pair began their romance. Purcell <a href=#>proposed in April 2023</a> and the couple tied the knot that August.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadp52eu6qvjKmsq5uVobm0ecOaq6Kml2K1qr%2FTqKmyZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
