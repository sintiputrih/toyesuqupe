At this stage, it looks likely that Alfred Molina, Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield are going to be involved, but Tom Hardy’s Venom, Jared Leto’s Morbius and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">three different Green Goblins</a> sounds a little too far-fetched.</p><p data-characters=441 data-current-count=441 data-injectable=true>Of course, it comes with the territory of being a multiversal superhero sequel, with the rumor mill swirling around Sam Raimi’s Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">throwing up just as many potential candidates</a>. There’s certainly plenty of overlap between the three upcoming projects revolving around the idea of alternate realities, so it was inevitable that Elizabeth Olsen would find herself drawn into the speculation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/130835837_447305702927857_7123622085921608471_n.jpg><p data-characters=370 data-current-count=370 data-injectable=false>The WandaVision star takes second billing behind Benedict Cumberbatch in Multiverse of Madness, who himself plays a major role in Spider-Man 3. And in a recent interview, the actress appeared to play coy when asked if she was part of the web-slinging sequel after an extensive roll call of hypothetical names were rattled off, as she didn’t completely rule it out.</p><p>“I assume you might think I’m in it if everyone’s in it, but I haven’t shown up to that party quite yet, I don’t think.”</p><p data-characters=254 data-current-count=624 data-injectable=false>Obviously, it wouldn’t be too difficult for Raimi to shoot a quick scene or two in order to airdrop Olsen into <strong>Spider-Man 3</strong> and provide some connective tissue, but for the time being, it sounds as though Scarlet Witch isn’t involved just yet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJonKWhqpavpsDHZqalq5WjerS8yJ2cq6WRo3p0ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
