The most well-known and effective engine is probably the <a href=# title="Holon Engine (TCG)">Holon Engine</a>, which consists entirely of Trainer and Supporter cards. However, while engines are often centered around Trainer cards, some engines are centered around Pokémon cards. However, if an engine is based around one or more Pokémon cards, the Pokémon will generally sit on a player's Bench and utilize its <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Poké-Power (TCG)">Poké-Power</a> or <a href=# title="Ability (TCG)">Ability</a>. Some cards could be considered engines by themselves, such as <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Delcatty (EX Power Keepers 8)">Delcatty</a>. In essence, the power of an engine is its drawing or searching ability.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Single-card_engines>Single-card engines</span></h2><p><i>Single-card engines are engines that are able to function virtually by themselves. However, they are <b>often</b> used in combination with other cards.</i></p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Sword_and_Shield_engines><a href=# title="Sword & Shield (TCG)">Sword and Shield</a> engines</span></h3><h4><span class=mw-headline id=Bibarel_Industrious_Incisors_engine><a href=# title="Bibarel (Brilliant Stars 121)">Bibarel</a> <i>Industrious Incisors</i> engine</span></h4><p>The <i>Bibarel</i> engine was centered on <a href=# title="Bibarel (Brilliant Stars 121)">Bibarel</a>'s <i>Industrious Incisors</i> <a href=# title="Ability (TCG)">Ability</a>. Once per turn, <i>Industrious Incisors</i> allowed a player to draw cards until they had five cards in their hand. Being a Stage 1 Pokémon, Bibarel was able to be set up fast, and had the advantage of not needing to discard a card from the player's hand, compared to cards like <a href=# title="Cinccino (Sword & Shield 147)">Cinccino</a>'s Make Do. The engine further got an upgrade with the release of the <a href=# title="Crown Zenith (TCG)">Crown Zenith</a> expansion, which introduced <a href=# title="Bidoof (Crown Zenith 111)">Bidoof</a>. Bidoof's ability, <i>Carefree Countenance</i>, allowed it to be protected from damage dealt while it was on the bench, preventing cards such as <a href=# title="Rapid Strike Urshifu VMAX (Battle Styles 88)">Rapid Strike Urshifu VMAX</a> and <a href=# title="Radiant Greninja (Astral Radiance 46)">Radiant Greninja</a> to Knock Out it for easy Prize Cards.</p><h4><span class=mw-headline id=Comfey_Flower_Selecting_engine><a href=# title="Comfey (Lost Origin 79)">Comfey</a> <i>Flower Selecting</i> engine</span></h4><p>The <i>Comfey engine</i> was centered on <a href=# title="Comfey (Lost Origin 79)">Comfey</a>'s <i>Flower Selecting</i> <a href=# title="Ability (TCG)">Ability</a>. Once per turn, <i>Flower Selecting</i> allowed a player to look at the top two cards of the deck, put one into their hand, and put the other into the <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Lost Zone (TCG)">Lost Zone</a>. Comfey's advantage of being a Basic Pokémon, as well as its ability being able to be refreshed, allowed chains of Comfey to repeatedly use its Flower Selecting ability via cards like <a href=# title="Scoop Up Net (Rebel Clash 165)">Scoop Up Net</a>, <a href=# title="Escape Rope (Plasma Storm 120)">Escape Rope</a>, and <a href=# title="Switch Cart (Astral Radiance 154)">Switch Cart</a>. In addition, the card's secondary ability of sending a card to the Lost Zone helped cards like <a href=# title="Cramorant (Lost Origin 50)">Cramorant</a>, <a href=# title="Sableye (Lost Origin 70)">Sableye</a>, <a href=# title="Mirage Gate (Lost Origin 163)">Mirage Gate</a>, and <a href=# class=new title="Giratina VSTAR (Lost Origin 131 (page does not exist)">Giratina VSTAR</a> to function in the decks <a href=# class=new title="Lost Box (TCG) (page does not exist)">Lost Box</a> and <a href=# class=new title="Giratina VSTAR (TCG) (page does not exist)">Giratina VSTAR</a>.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=HeartGold_and_SoulSilver_engines><a href=# class=mw-redirect title="HeartGold and SoulSilver (TCG)">HeartGold and SoulSilver</a> engines</span></h3><h4><span class=mw-headline id=Magnezone_Prime_Magnetic_Draw_engine><a href=# title="Magnezone (Triumphant 96)">Magnezone Prime</a> <i>Magnetic Draw</i> engine</span></h4><p>The <i>Magnetic Draw engine</i> was centered almost entirely on <a href=# title="Magnezone (Triumphant 96)">Magnezone Prime</a>'s <i>Magnetic Draw</i> <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Poké-Power (TCG)">Poké-Power</a>. Once per turn, <i>Magnetic Draw</i> allowed a player to draw cards until they had six cards in hand. Magnezone Prime-centric decks were particularly prevalent during the <a href=# title="HeartGold & SoulSilver (TCG)">HeartGold & SoulSilver</a>-on format, when <i>Magnetic Draw</i> provided one of the only Pokémon-based draw engines. It was often used in combination with <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Judge (TCG)">Judge</a> in decks such as <a href=# title="Megazone (TCG)">Megazone</a> to potentially leave the opponent with a small, useless hand while giving the Magnezone Prime player an out with <i>Magnetic Draw</i>.</p><h4><span class=mw-headline id=Ninetales_Roast_Reveal_engine><a href=# title="Ninetales (HeartGold & SoulSilver 7)">Ninetales</a> <i>Roast Reveal</i> engine</span></h4><p>The <i>Roast Reveal engine</i> was based around <a href=# title="Ninetales (HeartGold & SoulSilver 7)">Ninetales</a>' <i>Roast Reveal</i> Poké-Power.

Since Claydol sits on the Bench, it is vulnerable to being sniped by attacks such as <a href=# title="Garchomp C LV.X (Supreme Victors 145)">Garchomp C LV.X</a>'s <i>Dragon Rush</i>, at which point the Claydol player may be left without a way to reliably draw cards.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Ruby_and_Sapphire_engines><a href=# title="EX Ruby & Sapphire (TCG)">Ruby and Sapphire</a> engines</span></h3><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/a/aa/DelcattyEXPowerKeepers8.jpg/300px-DelcattyEXPowerKeepers8.jpg decoding=async width=200 height=279 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h4><span class=mw-headline id=Delcatty_Energy_Draw_engine><a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Delcatty (EX Power Keepers 8)">Delcatty</a> <i>Energy Draw</i> engine</span></h4><p>The <i>Energy Draw engine</i> was centered around <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Delcatty (EX Power Keepers 8)">Delcatty</a>, from the <a href=# title="EX Ruby & Sapphire (TCG)">EX Ruby & Sapphire</a> and <a href=# title="EX Power Keepers (TCG)">EX Power Keepers</a> expansions, and its Poké-Power, <i>Energy Draw</i>. <i>Energy Draw</i> allows the player to discard an <a href=# title="Energy card (TCG)">Energy card</a> from their hand to draw up to three cards, once per turn. This was exceptionally useful in decks that actually benefited from discarding Energies, such as <a href=# title="Infercatty (TCG)">Infercatty</a>.</p><h4><span class=mw-headline id=Pidgeot_Quick_Search_engine><a href=# title="Pidgeot (EX FireRed & LeafGreen 10)">Pidgeot</a> <i>Quick Search</i> engine</span></h4><p>The <i>Quick Search engine</i> utilized <a href=# title="Pidgeot (EX FireRed & LeafGreen 10)">Pidgeot</a> from the <a href=# title="EX FireRed & LeafGreen (TCG)">EX FireRed & LeafGreen</a> expansion. Pidgeot had a Poké-Power called <i>Quick Search</i> which allowed the player to search for any one card from their deck and add it to their hand, once per turn. This was not stackable, meaning that if one had multiple Pidgeot in play, they could still only use the power once. However, Pidgeot was <i>the</i> backbone support Pokémon of many EX-era decks. It was often used in combination with a variety of searching and drawing <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Trainer (TCG)">Trainer</a> and <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Supporter (TCG)">Supporter</a> cards, most notably <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Rare Candy (TCG)">Rare Candy</a> to make it easier to get out.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Multi-card_engines>Multi-card engines</span></h2><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/4/4f/CastawayEXCrystalGuardians72.jpg/300px-CastawayEXCrystalGuardians72.jpg decoding=async width=200 height=283 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h4><span class=mw-headline id=Castaway_engine><a href=# title="Castaway (EX Crystal Guardians 72)">Castaway</a> engine</span></h4><p>The <i>Castaway engine</i> was centered around <a href=# title="Castaway (EX Crystal Guardians 72)">Castaway</a>, a <a href=# title="Supporter card (TCG)">Supporter card</a> from the <a href=# title="EX Crystal Guardians (TCG)">EX Crystal Guardians</a> expansion. Castaway was often used in non-δ decks during the <a href=# title="EX Holon Phantoms (TCG)">EX Holon Phantoms</a>-onward <a href=# title="Rotation (TCG)">Rotation</a>.

Generally, Cyrus's Conspiracy was used in combination with <a href=# title="Team Galactic's Invention G-109 SP Radar (Rising Rivals 96)">SP Radar</a>, <a href=# title="Team Galactic's Invention G-101 Energy Gain (Platinum 116)">Energy Gain</a>, <a href=# title="Team Galactic's Invention G-103 Power Spray (Platinum 117)">Power Spray</a>, <a href=# title="Team Galactic's Invention G-105 Poké Turn (Platinum 118)">Poké Turn</a>, and a number of single copies of other Supporter cards. Cyrus's Conspiracy was remarkably similar to Castaway. However, Cyrus's Conspiracy allowed the player to search for a Trainer card with <i>Team Galactic's Invention</i> in its name, rather than a Pokémon Tool card. The Cyrus Engine was the primary manner in which SP decks, such as <a href=# title="LuxApe (TCG)">LuxApe</a> and <a href=# title="LuxChomp (TCG)">LuxChomp</a>, set up and caused disruption.
