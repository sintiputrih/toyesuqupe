I like to refer to myself as an introverted socialite. Having any sort of routine salvages what sanity I have left. But, then again, any chance I have to be impulsive, I am 100000% down. So, <strong>Winter House</strong> was an opportunity to try different things and have a proper vacation."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rachel isn't kidding when she says that.</p><p>In fact, she jokes that it didn't even completely register for her when she was cast - because she was so on-the-go.</p><p>"Honestly, I think I was in the midst of an installation when I found out, so I didn't get a chance to really process it."</p><p>So, when did the realization hit?</p><p>"When I started to pack, I realized I was bringing 10 huge storage bags <strong>and</strong> a suitcase. Then, I started to panic. Like, 'Omg ... I'm <strong>really</strong> doing this slash <strong>what</strong> am I doing?!' It all happened so fast."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rachel-reveals-the-hardest-part-about-being-on-quot-winter-house-quot>Rachel Reveals The Hardest Part About Being On "Winter House"</h2><p>Given her busy lifestyle, it only makes sense that for Rachel, the toughest aspect of the Winter House experience was slowing down.</p><p>"The hardest part, for me, was definitely being away from my business. My work is my passion, and the love of my life. It brings me so much love and purpose - so not being creative for <strong>any</strong> amount of time makes me kind of crazy and anxious."</p><p>That said, she laughs that she was surprised by just how taxing partying could be.</p><p>"I was surprised by how exhausting having fun would be! I'm an early riser, and you guys totally get to see that - but the fun wears you down. I went from waking up at 6, to lounging in bed until, like, 9am. That's <strong>so</strong> unlike me."</p><p>Even so, Rachel is a seasoned eventing pro, so she adapted pretty quickly.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Who Is Jason Cameron? Everything We Know About 'Winter House' Star</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As she explains,<strong> "You have to be flexible and just go with it."</strong></p><p>"You really have to relinquish control, roll with it, and make the most of each day."</p><h2 id=rachel-reflects-on-going-in-as-a-newbie>Rachel Reflects On Going In As A Newbie</h2><p>Another thing Rachel's career and personality, in general, helped her with on the show was navigating newbie status.</p><p><strong>"I like meeting new people,"</strong> she begins.</p><p>However, she also points out that many might not have realized that at first - simply because she has a tendency to take it all in, before going all in.</p><p>"I may come across as shy or reserved, but I'm observing and reading the room. I hate when people just speak to be heard, and I've learned over the years that you don't need to be the loudest person to be noticed. I took my time assessing the relationships and dynamics, and I was pretty much playing catch up. Like, 'Why are we mad?' 'Who did what?' 'When did this happen?' But, I think that with each episode, you see me begin to open up and be the bubbly, happy person that I am!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rachel also explains that she went in, knowing that there may be some reservations on her co-stars' parts.</p><p>"Of course, it was a little difficult navigating the long-standing connections people have, because when things go wrong, people naturally gravitate towards those they know and trust. With being a new person, I didn't take it personally. I stayed true to myself, and I got along with everyone."</p><h2 id=so-what-did-she-learn-from-the-experience>So, What Did She Learn From The Experience?</h2><p>All in all, Rachel's tenure on Winter House was pretty mellow, due in large part to her personal and professional experience.</p><p>That said, she also learned something new from her time on the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I've realized how much I want to help others. Sharing my story of being adopted, and losing my father, brother and both grandparents in the last 10 years is, and always will be hard to share, and I'm really thankful I was given the space to tell it in my way. The outreach I've received has been mind-blowing. My mission in life has always been to make the world a more beautiful place, in whatever capacity I can, so gaining this exposure and platform to do that really gives me a new sense of purpose."</p><p>Continuing that train of thought, she explains, <strong>"I want to share with people that even though bad things happen, life goes on, and you can make the most of it.</strong></p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How ‘Winter House’ Couple Craig Conover And Paige Desorbo Got Together</a></span></p><p>"I know the show is about having fun, but there's so much more to it than that - and if someone can relate to my story, then I feel like I'm doing something of value."</p><h2 id=rachel-39-s-advice-to-future-quot-winter-house-quot-stars>Rachel's Advice To Future "Winter House" Stars</h2><p>In light of just how full an experience Winter House was for Rachel, we couldn't help but ask what she'd tell other aspiring cast members.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"It's actually a piece of advice Kyle [Cooke] gave me before we left for Vermont," </strong>she smiles.</p><p><strong>"Don't do anything you wouldn't do normally. Stay true to yourself, and you won't have any regrets."</strong></p><p>"I couldn't agree more. Being authentic goes a long way, so don't try being someone you're not. You'd only be doing yourself an injustice."</p><p>Rachel Clark may be a newbie this season, but it's safe to say she's wise beyond her seasons!</p><p>Fans can catch all new episodes of <strong>Winter House </strong>every Friday on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Hayu</strong></a>.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>The Cast Of Bravo's New Series 'Winter House' Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicsZucqsCqwsRmqZqbmJq5bq%2FLmqmkZZ%2Bjeri02GaqoZ1dn7yqusSdZLChnqmys3nHqKysnV2luba%2FjK2fnmWjqbKtuMCrZJqcpp6wpnnKsqOeZZOkvKyxjKCYr51dnbKzew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
