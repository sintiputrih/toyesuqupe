The instructions were vague and said to enhance results by applying Collagenius toning gel, which wasn’t provided with the product. There was no safety warning about using another gel so I used a similar product (designed for a facial toning device) that I already owned.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>I opted for the light red therapy as I have some light scarring on my face and thought anti-ageing and sun damage would help my skin see the best results. I used it once daily for two days – though the instructions don’t make clear how long it will take to see an impact or how frequently to use it.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>I was slightly confused during my first time using the product as it’s not very clear when it’s actually on and it’s difficult to feel any impact unless using a gel alongside the device.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>During my second use it made a crackling sound and actually started smoking. This happened twice until I turned it off and the space in between the electrode and the device was red hot. I looked at the safety guidance and it didn’t mention anything that could explain why, so I stopped using it immediately and haven’t since. Overall I wasn’t really able to get a clear picture of how well the device worked so I don’t feel I can give it any stars!</p><p class=mol-ratings><strong>Rating: <strong><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/articles/ratingStars/rating_showbiz_0.gif width=55 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></strong></strong></p><p>Source: | This article originally belongs to <a href=#>Dailymail.co.uk</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnlpq6orXLZquroZWoerW0xGajmqyVqMFurdNmn6illWKzoq%2FImqNmn5GZtKbA0mg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
