Florence Pugh, the celebrated actress in films such as Little Women and Midsommer and has a couple of Oscar nominations, is supposedly being hired in the sequel.</span></p><p><span>Dune 2 is the sequel to the critically acclaimed sci-fi film Dune, starring Zendya and Timothée Chalamet. </span><span>While nothing has been confirmed, Pugh is expected to play Princess Irulan Corrino, Emperor Shaddam Corrino IV’s eldest daughter. Her role will be Timothée Chalamet’s romantic interest in Timothée Chalamet’s Paul Atreides.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Florence-Pugh2.jpg><h2>‘Dune 2’ is all about</h2><p><span>Dune 2 will be released on October 20, 2023. The sequel’s production is expected to begin this summer. The cast reportedly includes Timothee Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Josh Brolin, Stellan Skarsgard, Dave Bautista, Zendaya, and Javier Bardem from the first film. Denis Villeneuve will also return to direct the sequel.</span></p><p><span>Villeneuve has been praised for adopting a novel that was said to be nearly unadaptable and turning it into a successful project. He deserves credit for dividing the novel into two parts for adaptation. The first installment, Dune, is already available.</span></p><p><span>Viewers may anticipate seeing Paul’s ascent to power among the Fremen and his eventual insurrection against Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV in Dune 2. The Atreides family also grows, with Paul and Chani falling in love and Lady Jessica giving birth to a daughter, Alia.</span></p><p><span>The first film grossed approximately $400 million worldwide and received ten Academy Award nominations, including best picture and best-adapted screenplay. As a result, there is high anticipation for the film’s second installment.</span></p><p><span>Florence Pugh is quickly becoming one of Hollywood’s brightest and most successful stars. The Oscar winner was first introduced to the Marvel Cinematic Universe in Black Widow when she played Natasha Romanoff’s sister, Yelena. She will also reprise her role in Marvel’s Hawkeye series, where the character quickly wins over MCU fans.</span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>'Dune 2</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Florence Pugh</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGidpaeimruksYyprKCgXZiutMDIp55mq6CasLa4wK2gqKajYravecOupZ5lYmKxs7XVnmSfmZ6oeqq606hkmmWWp7Kvxtho</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
