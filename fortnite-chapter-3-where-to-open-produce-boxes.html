Many of the quests are straightforward and will be completed in due course just by playing the game. However, one of the not so straightforward quests for this week is locating produce boxes and opening a total of five boxes in either Condo Canyon or Sleepy Sound.</p><p>Produce boxes contain a variety of fruits and vegetables that players can use for heals. They have a 100% spawn rate and can be either searched or destroyed. Each box will drop a total of four items in stacks of two or four of the same item. Players can use these items for heals or keep them in their inventory for quick heals to use later on in the game during fights when there simply isn’t enough time to use a&nbsp;<a href=#>medkit or a big shield potion in Fortnite</a>.</p><p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag>SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Fortnite Crew Membership March 2022 (Start Date, Price, & Rewards)</a></span></p><p>Players can find produce boxes at Sleepy Sound within the grocery store and fish sticks restaurant, alongside kitchens within residential buildings. Behind the NOMS grocery store, there will also be a cargo truck outside, containing two boxes that can contribute to the total amount needed for the quest. Fortunately, this quest does not have to be completed within one game so that players can visit Condo Canyon in a different game if they would instead focus on winning the game after visiting one of the POIs.</p><h2>Where To Find Produce Boxes In Fortnite</h2><figure class=item-img></figure><p>The boxes can be identified by their green color with ‘NOMS’ written on the top of the box. They contain a variety of fruits and vegetables,&nbsp;<a href=#>also known as foraged items in&nbsp;Fortnite</a>. The second POI involved in the quest is Condo Canyon, which holds a fair amount of produce boxes. Condo Canyon is a retro suburb, finished with a town center full of stores. Players can find a full five produce boxes in the diners and Noms grocery store in the town center. There is also one more box that can be found inside the ice cream parlor next door, on top of a freezer inside. Each produce box has a max stack count of 15, and all take one second to consume. Here’s everything players can find inside a produce box in Fortnite:</p><ul><li><strong>Apple:&nbsp;</strong>Heals 5HP</li><li><strong>Banana:&nbsp;</strong>Heals 5HP</li><li><strong>Cabbage:&nbsp;</strong>Heals 10 HP</li><li><strong>Coconut:&nbsp;</strong>Heals 5HP/Sheild</li><li><strong>Corn:&nbsp;</strong>Heals 10HP</li><li><strong>Pepper:&nbsp;</strong>Heals 5HP plus 60 seconds of increased movement speed</li><li><strong>Mushroom:&nbsp;</strong>Heals 5 Sheilds</li><li><strong>Slurp Mushroom:&nbsp;</strong>Heals 10HP/Sheild over two seconds</li></ul><p>Coming to the end of the season, players should focus on completing as many quests as possible to ensure that they can unlock everything possible from the Battle-Pass and not miss out on any high-tier exclusive rewards.
