Daytime Confidential’s sources insist that Coloma has been written out, so that may be clue number one in what’s ahead for Nikolas.</p><p>When you pair that with the fact that Coloma declined to film his final scenes, he seems to be getting an actual exit story.</p><p>Coloma refusing to film wouldn’t be an issue if a permanent recast was already lined up and waiting in the wings.</p><p>Of course, <a href=# rel=noopener>Adam Huss may fill in for a few episodes</a> to wrap things up due to Coloma’s refusal. The point is the show’s said to have written Coloma out – and that presumably means they’ve written Nikolas out, too.</p><p>That said, SOD got an interesting comment from the ABC soap that confirmed Coloma’s departure and offered a timeframe for when he’ll finish airing.</p><p>According to the show, “Marcus Coloma will no longer be playing the role of Nikolas Cassadine. His last airdate will be at the end of January.”</p><p>The word choice leaves the door open for someone else to be playing the role of Nikolas – perhaps beyond a temporary replacement.</p><p>Could the plan be to rest the character for a while and bring in a permanent recast somewhere down the road?</p><p>Adam Huss is perfectly fine as a temp Nikolas, but he doesn’t seem like a good fit long-term.</p><p>Some GH fans are holding out hope that Tyler Christopher might make a comeback as Nik, but the show could choose to go with someone new.</p><p>Regardless, the goal seems to be taking Nikolas off canvas for a while. Even if Nikolas returns with a new face eventually, all signs point to an official exit for now.</p><p>Nikolas could land in prison over this whole Esme Prince (Avery Pohl) hostage situation – or he could go on the run to avoid it!</p><p>Of course, we can’t rule out the idea of “The Hook” claiming Nikolas as a victim if GH gets gutsy.</p><p>Ava Jerome (Maura West), Ryan Chamberlain (Jon Lindstrom) and Heather Webber (Alley Mills) are all out to get Nikolas as well, so danger could come at him from multiple angles.</p><p>It seems like a mistake to kill Nikolas off again after going to the trouble of bringing him back from the dead.</p><p>Nevertheless, it’s an option to consider since things remain up in the air regarding Nikolas’ upcoming departure.</p><p>General Hospital spoilers say Nikolas will continue to face bad news as his life unravels, so stay tuned for updates on the mess!</p><p>CDL’s the place to be for the hottest <a href=# rel=noopener>General Hospital spoilers, updates and news, so drop by regularly.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaWtnl5q7pr7ApWShp6OltrWty2aqqaeZobKzv4ynoKSnnJbAbrLUrayrnV2nsrexwKWcnWWnnrmtecahZKmdoqKur7HNraOyZaKasKK%2F02amq2WbmrKxecKhmKuZk6mys3nOn51mm5Gjw6K%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
