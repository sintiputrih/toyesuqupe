(Watch clip above.)</p><p>"I got into a massive car crash outside of the <a href=#>Fox</a> lot â€” completely totaling my car," she says. "When I get into the room for my audition, I literally was still pulling pieces of glass out of my hair. They're like, 'Are you okay?' I'm like, 'I'm fine!'"</p><p>The star, who plays high-strung sophomore Rachel Berry on the hit Fox series, says she was surprisingly demanding when she sang Les Miserables' "On My Own" in the audition.</p><p>"I start singing my first song, and the piano player skipped through the second verse, so right in the middle of my song, I was like, 'Excuse me!'" she says. "Very Rachel Berry!"</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Perhaps her confidence during the casting session was because show creator Ryan Murphy actually wrote the part of Rachel for Michele, whom he met during her run on Broadway's Spring Awakening.</p><p>Still, she says she can't believe she is on Glee: "I come from a world of musical theater, so I never really thought I would be on a television show!"</p><p>http://www.foxconnect.com/<br>http://www.fox.com/glee</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJ6lnZViwLWt0Wafmpxdoq60v8ivnGabkad6oq%2FCopuepqRisaLFjKidZqCVp3qiwcOiq6KnnmJ%2FcX2PcGho</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
