Pride Festival and Parade], let him experience the love, the unity and discover on his own what this is all about. I think that’s what my job is,” she explained exclusively to&nbsp;Us&nbsp;in June. “It’s not to mind-lead, it’s to lead an experience. [Maceo can] be who he is and make up his own mind and … develop his own sensibilities.”</p><p>The&nbsp;John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum&nbsp;star, who is also the mother of 11-year-old daughter Nahla, is glad she waited to enter the realm of parenthood too. “You’re so <a href=#>much more ready to be a parent after 40</a> than when you’re 20,” she told&nbsp;Us&nbsp;in May. “You know yourself better. You’ve done a lot of things for yourself, selfishly. When you wait later in life, you can really put your kids forward, I think, in a more meaningful way.”</p><p>Berry shares Maceo with ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Olivier Martinez</strong></a> and Nahla with ex-boyfriend <a href=#><strong>Gabriel Aubry</strong></a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGahmZyhsm6uxKupsmWimq6kwNJmq6hlmJbDqrrGZp%2BappSoerCyjJpknKeeqMGzwcKtoKimXay8s7fEq2Y%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
