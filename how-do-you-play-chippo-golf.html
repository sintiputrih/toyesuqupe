Here's a step-by-step guide on how to play.</p><li readability=1><p>Setup: Start by removing the chipping mats from the back of the boards and fold out the legs. Place the boards a suitable distance apart, usually around 15-20 feet.</p></li><li readability=0><p>Equipment: <a href=#>Chippo Golf</a> comes with six high-density foam balls. Each player will need their own set of balls. You can also use regular golf balls if you prefer.</p></li><li readability=3.8070175438596><p>Game Modes: <a href=#>Chippo Golf </a>offers three recommended game modes, but players can create their own games and scoring system. The three modes are Match Play, Cornhole Style, and One on One. Choose the mode that suits your preferences.</p></li><li readability=5><p>Match Play: In Match Play, players can compete in teams of two or individually. Each player takes turns chipping three balls onto the boards. The scores are tallied, and the team or player with the highest score wins the hole. The game continues for a predetermined number of holes, and the team or player with the most holes won wins the match.</p></li><li readability=4><p>Cornhole Style: In this mode, points cancel out. Each turn results in only one player scoring. If Player A scores 3 points and Player B scores 1 point in a single turn, Player A would receive 2 points (3 - 1 = 2) for that turn. The game continues until a predetermined score is reached or a set number of rounds are played.</p></li><li readability=2><p>One on One: This mode is played with six balls per player. Each player takes turns chipping the balls onto the boards.The total score for all six shots is tallied, and the player with the highest score wins.</p></li><li readability=2.8658536585366><p>Scoring: <a href=#>Chippo Golf </a>offers various scoring options. Hitting the board on a fly earns 1 point (Boardie), draining a shot in the larger center hole earns 3 points (3-Hole), and sending the ball to its home in either top corner hole earns 5 points.</p></li><li readability=3><p>Enjoyment: Chippo Golf is not just about the game; it's about the fun and camaraderie. Play with friends, enjoy some friendly banter, and even consider adding a little bit of friendly gambling to make it more exciting!</p></li><p>Remember, <a href=#>Chippo Golf</a> is a versatile game, and you can modify the rules and scoring system to suit your preferences. Get creative, have fun, and let the chips fly!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6hprBllKR6urvUZqelmalisKm1z6mmZp%2BfobM%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
