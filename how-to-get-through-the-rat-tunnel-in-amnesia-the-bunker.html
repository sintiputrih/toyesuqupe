Savvy players can expand his arsenal even further by exploring every nook and cranny of the bunker.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=327 data-current-count=636 data-injectable=true>While this may seem off-brand for Amnesia, rest assured that the game is every bit as terrifying as its predecessor – as Frictional has also upped the ante when it comes to Henri’s adversaries. We’ve got the monstrous stalker as our primary threat, but there’s also the matter of some very pesky rats to navigate.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=255 data-current-count=255 data-injectable=false>While, for the most part, you can navigate your way around the vermin, at one point or another in your journey through The Bunker, you will come upon an unavoidable encounter with the rats while in the Maintenance sub-level. Here’s how to get past them.</p><h2 id=h-how-to-get-past-the-maintenance-rats-in-amnesia-the-bunker data-injectable=false>How to get past the Maintenance rats in Amnesia: The Bunker</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/amnesia-the-bunker-1.png><p data-characters=331 data-current-count=331 data-injectable=false>Depending on the difficulty level you’ve set the game to, the most obvious answer may well be to simply charge on through and hope for the best – just bring a few bandages or a med kit to use on the other side. Probably not a feasible solution for Hard, and maybe even Normal difficulty – so let’s keep brainstorming.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=507 data-current-count=838 data-injectable=true>Your objective here is to, at the very least, thin the horde of rats by scaring some of them away, in the hope of reverting to the above method to make it to the other side alive. The simplest and safest way is to fashion a torch which will scare the rats away. You can craft one using a piece of wood, cloth, and a lighter, the latter of which is inside a locker in Mission Storage. Given that locker code locations are randomized, you’ve got some exploring to do if you want to take this approach.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=245 data-current-count=245 data-injectable=false>If you just want to brute-force the issue (we can’t blame you, this game is terrifying), there are alternative methods – although they’re mostly noisy and likely to attract the stalker to your location, so as always, watch your back.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=460 data-current-count=705 data-injectable=false>There are a number of randomly placed resources around the bunker to aid you in charging through the tunnel – flares and grenades immediately come to mind. We wouldn’t bother using your precious revolver bullets on them, there’s simply too many rats to justify it. However you choose to tackle this grotesque and irritating obstacle, there’s only really one right answer, and it’s in the game’s loading screens&nbsp; – experiment, adapt, survive.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZon6ivXam8brPErWStoKKkwqi0jK2fnmWilsFuwNSnpZ6kXZ67bq3Mp5ysoZFiwamxjJusp6OVp3w%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
