The Playboy founder married three times, but was mostly recognized for <a href=#>having multiple live-in girlfriends</a> at the Playboy Mansion.</p><p class=p1>Though the media mogul tried his hand at marriage, his first two attempts— to childhood sweetheart <strong>Mildred Williams</strong>&nbsp;<span class=s1>from&nbsp;</span>1949 to&nbsp;1959, and to <strong>Kimberley Conrad</strong> from 1989 to&nbsp;2010 — didn’t last. He is <a href=#>survived by his third wife</a>, <a href=#><strong>Crystal Hefner</strong></a> (née Harris), as well as four adult children from his two previous marriages.&nbsp;<span class=s1>(Hugh shared Christie and David with Williams and Marston and <a href=#>Cooper</a> with Conrad.)</span></p><p class=p3>Hugh’s love life was <a href=#>the subject of the&nbsp;<i>Girls Next Door&nbsp;</i>reality TV series</a>, which aired on E! from 2006 to 2009. The six-season series primarily highlighted his relationships with the likes of<a href=#><strong> Holly Madison</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Bridget Marquardt</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Kendra Wilkinson</strong></a>. The final season of the show introduced Crystal, and twins <a href=#><strong>Kristina</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Karissa Shannon</strong></a>.</p><p class=p3>“I’ve been blessed&nbsp;for many, many things but to find true love at this age, at this stage of life, is beyond words,” Hugh previously told&nbsp;<i><a href=#>E! News</a>&nbsp;</i>in 2014, <a href=#>two years after marrying Crystal</a>. “Things could not be better.”</p><p class=p3>After the former magazine editor’s death, Crystal exclusively <a href=#>opened up about her loss</a> to&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly.</i></p><p class=p3>“It’s been a whirlwind,” Crystal&nbsp;<a href=#>told&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>in March 2020</a>. “It’s been trying to find myself. I became someone else’s identity for 10 years. I’m finding my own identity and place in the world. It’s scary. … I’ve been doing a lot of traveling and seeing the world. I didn’t do much of that living at the house. Hef and I were just homebodies. He didn’t like me traveling. I guess I’m making up for lost time.”</p><p class=p3>Hugh’s <a href=#>past relationships made headlines once again</a> after the January 2022 premiere of <a href=#>the A&E docuseries <i>Secrets of Playboy</i></a>. The&nbsp;<i>Vegas Diaries&nbsp;</i>author and other former Playmates <a href=#>came forward with allegations about the Illinois native’s inappropriate behavior</a> during his mansion residency.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p3>“We <a href=#>sign our names to support Hugh M. Hefner</a>. From all we know of Hef, he was a person of upstanding character, exceptional kindness and dedication to free thought,” a collective of former Playboy employees and models <a href=#>wrote in a joint statement, obtained by&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly</i>, in February 2022</a>. “He demonstrated a commitment to living an honest life beyond everything else. Our time within Hugh Hefner’s Playboy and the organization’s subsidiaries remains a period all of us are fond of.”</p><p class=p5>Scroll through to look back at the icon’s greatest loves:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNktbazx2afnp6emr%2B0edairZ6rXZa7pXnGoqmlnqKesq%2Bw0maroaqfqrSpedOhnGaxlZa%2FtHnPopqsZadqfXd8knJm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
