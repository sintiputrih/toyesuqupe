Cover up”</h2><p>New mom Isabel, 24, was scrolling Facebook like she does every morning when she came across a video of herself at the beach, topless and breastfeeding her baby.&nbsp;</p><p>The caption on the video said: “<a href=#>I’m not shaming women who breastfeed</a> their babies.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The 24-year-old mother found the video of herself breastfeeding while she was scrolling on Facebook. <span class=credit>TikTok/izlomax</span></figure><p>“I’m shaming the woman who breastfed in public with no respect to cover themselves up and just let their boobs hang out (nipple included) for everyone to see! COVER TF UP !!!”</p><p>The post continued, “I shouldn’t have to cover my son’s eyes and explain why your boobs are out and quite frankly, I don’t want to see it either. Have some respect!”</p><p>And finally, it concluded: “For real cover yourself up, what the f**k is wrong with people?”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>“Imagine waking up and seeing this video of yourself”</h3><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">After discovering the post, Isabel took to her&nbsp;TikTok</a>&nbsp;to expose the woman who shamed her and defended her side of the story.&nbsp;</p><p>In the clip, Isabele appears topless, breastfeeding her baby (an iconic way to make a clap-back video if we do say so ourselves.)</p><p>“Imagine waking up, getting on Facebook, and seeing this video of yourself yesterday at the beach,” she began the viral clip which now has over half a million likes.</p><p>“Not only did this woman walk past me multiple times with her son, you had every opportunity in the world to say something to me. Not that I would have cared or stopped what I was doing, but you instead choose to post a video of me and my child on Facebook, publicly for the world to see,” she continued.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The caption on the video said: “I’m shaming the woman who breastfed in public with no respect to cover themselves up and just let their boobs hang out (nipple included) for everyone to see!

Feed your baby any way you choose. You are doing AMAZING,” one commenter wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>“Beautiful! I teach my boys it’s amazing that moms can do this and they can see it but don’t stare because it’s impolite,” another woman said.</p><p>Someone else replied, “I always tell people to put a shirt over&nbsp;their&nbsp;head <a href=#>so they don’t have to see me breastfeed</a> lol or they can go to the bathroom to eat while she eats at the table.”</p><p>“I nurse publicly and have for eight months now and this is my worst nightmare. I can’t imagine how you felt, I’m so sorry,” posted a fellow mom.</p><p>Then this person pointed out that the beach was a pretty normal place for people to wear little clothing anyway.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Isabel concludes the video by saying “Next time you see a mom breastfeeding her child in public, covered up or not, tell her how good of a job she’s doing.” <span class=credit>TikTok/izlomax</span></figure><p>“She’s at the beach… Most times people go half-naked with thongs or tiny tops. The woman can simply tell her son that babies eat that way or with a bottle…” they said.&nbsp;</p><p>“Complaining about nakedness AT A BEACH is insane anyways. Everyone is practically naked, some more than others. Who cares!” echoed a different user.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Fmam5fnnq4rdJmqpyqn6G5qrrGZqanZZaWsKauzqiiZpmemXq0rdZmmGaumZmysHnOn2SmsaOauad5waucmqukm7KmsMinnmahnmK9tq7Loppod5mpuqC%2Fzq6pnJ1tpa6zv8SlsGaZoJ6MqsDMmJqapaCWtqi6nKmYq6uVocagvsScpqallaOxprC%2BsKCdn5WpenNyyK2khp2UnsKuidKiq56Xp56xqLHTX6CtpYOkwrOvxHanmqqjmrm6q9GemqilnZq7pbHDmK6inJeawWe106aWnKeeqbKvwJywoJ2flamsqsDEpmRq</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
