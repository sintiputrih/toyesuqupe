On October 4, 2019, the chef uploaded a selfie of himself holding his lover in his arms on his Instagram page.</p><p>He captioned the image with “The one,” referring to Sami. Do you mean the girls’ tour or the world tour? Was both relieved to bring this one home and pleased. The only.

I appreciate you spending seven blissful hours with me today at the Apple store.</p><p>The couple is undoubtedly still together even though they are less frequently seen on each other’s social media accounts these days because there hasn’t been any word of a breakup. Before the couple caught the attention of the public, Sami had previously made headlines for her connection with celebrity actor Zac Efron.

The winner of the competition is given the chance to work as a guest chef with the Voltaggio brothers in one of their restaurants after the two brothers face off against the other competitors.</p><p>Initially, the 42-year-old chef entered the industry after completing his apprenticeship at The Greenbrier at age 21. He started working at the Florida Ritz Carlton Hotel. The chef spent years honing his culinary techniques at establishments like The Dining Room and Langham Huntington Hotel & Spa.
