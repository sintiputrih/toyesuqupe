I didn’t get it. That’s just what I looked like, and I was doing my job,” she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Jennifer-Love-Hewitt-Remembers-Gross-Comments-About-Her-Body-Teenager-001.jpg><p>Though she laughed it off at the time, the Heartbreakers actress wishes she would have called the treatment out while it was occurring.</p><p>“I was really tired of that conversation. … I remember one specific moment wishing that the acting had overshadowed all that,” she noted. “Now that I’m older, I think, ‘Gosh, I wish that I had known how inappropriate that was so I could have defended myself somehow or just not answered those questions.’”</p><p>According to the Texas native, watching the sixth episode of The New York Times Presents, titled “Framing Britney Spears,” helped her grasp how her own treatment had been unfair. Though seeing <a href=#><strong>Britney Spears</strong></a> go through the same thing she did hurt her heart, she hopes that the tide is turning when it comes to how people talk about young women’s bodies.</p><p>“I’m really grateful that we’re in a time where, hopefully, that narrative is going to change for young girls who are coming up now,” Hewitt said. ‘They won’t have to have those conversations.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In August 2019, the Ghost Whisperer alum told Us Weekly exclusively that having children of her own <a href=#>opened her up to vulnerability</a>.
