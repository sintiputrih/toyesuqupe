That’s the question,” Ice Cube replied.</p><p>“Why would they make a dumb decision like that? Are they trying to ruin Bud Light? Are they trying to take down some of our most iconic American brands?”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Spotify podcaster Joe Rogan criticized social media influencer Dylan Mulvaney as “mentally ill” on Thursday. <span class=credit>PowerfulJRE</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Rogan criticized Bud Light for its partnership with Mulvaney, whom he branded an “attention whore.” <span class=credit>Dylan Mulvaney/Instagram</span></figure><p>Rogan blamed pressure on corporations to adopt so-called “ESG” — environmental, social and governance standards — adding that Bud Light’s actions proved it was out of touch with “regular people.”</p><p>“Take a brand like Bud Light,” Rogan said.</p><p>“It’s for blue-collar drinking people and they like to watch football and drink Bud Light and then all of a sudden you have this mentally ill person who’s just an attention whore.”</p><p>Rogan then referred to the viral video of Kid Rock using an assault rifle to shoot cases of Bud Light.</p><p>“Once Kid Rock shoots your cans, you’ve got real problems,” Rogan said.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Rogan on Thursday interviewed rapper Ice Cube, who also slammed Bud Light. <span class=credit>You Tube/PowerfulJRE</span></figure><p>The Post has sought comment from Mulvaney and Anheuser-Busch.</p><p>Rogan’s latest salvo came after Mulvaney <a href=#>posted a video</a> to her 1.8 million Instagram followers, <a href=#>saying she felt “a loneliness that I wouldn’t wish on anyone”</a> and that Anheuser-Busch has done nothing to support her as she’s been ruthlessly dragged through the mud in the months following the failed campaign.</p><p>The next day, Anheuser-Busch pushed back against Mulvaney’s assertions.</p><p>The company said it is “committed to the programs and partnerships we have forged over decades with organizations across a number of communities, including those in the LGBTQ+ community.”</p><p>Rogan also slammed Bud Light’s decision to sponsor the Toronto Pride event, calling it “silly.”</p><p>The podcaster and Ice Cube then turned their attention toward Target, the retailer that also sparked boycott calls over its Pride-themed merchandise.</p><p>“I think that’s an ESG thing, and <a href=#>Target lost billions of dollars</a>,” Rogan said.</p><p>“Because people are sick of this s–t. They’re sick of social things that are controversial, getting stuffed into your face and where you have to accept it, and people are like ‘I don’t wanna accept it. I’m just here for f—ing toilet paper.'”</p><p>Target <a href=#>relocated Pride merchandise</a> to the back of <a href=#>some stores in certain locations</a> in response to alleged threats to its employees, according to the company.</p><p>The Post has also sought comment from Target.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Mulvaney last week accused Bud Light of not sufficiently supporting her in the face of intense backlash.</figure><p>Last month, Rogan took Bud Light to task for its partnership with Mulvaney.</p><p>“Can you imagine, you’re just gonna send a f—ing can to some confused person,” Rogan remarked during a podcast episode featuring comedian Theo Von.</p><p>“You send that person a f—ing can with their face on, and your company loses $20 billion. That is wild s–, man.”</p><p>In April, he&nbsp;<a href=#>bashed the influencer</a>&nbsp;as an “attention whore,” while talking about the company’s failed attempt to move away from its bread-and-butter “frat culture.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3BmaWtfn7ymedGonpqmXai5ornSZqSepqSWua3FjKKjpWWUrrmiuoymrKWukaOyunnAn6ueql2XwqV5y6Keoaxdm7aiv8KoZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
