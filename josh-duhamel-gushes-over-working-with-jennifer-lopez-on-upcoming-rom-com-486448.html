First of all, we are in the Dominican Republic, which is absolutely beautiful. Jen was also a dream to work with, she is an absolute pro, totally engaged and loved the project. We had a great relationship. I have known her forever so it was very easy for us to get in lock and step.’</p><p>View this post on Instagram</p><p>A post shared by Josh Duhamel (@joshduhamel)</p><p>He went on to gush that ‘The crew, cast, we have a great cast and Jason Moore, the director, it was just one of those situations where everything kind of fit perfectly. I am very proud of the way it turned out and I cannot wait for it all to come together.’</p><p>The movie is set to be released in theaters on June 29, next year and it is all about a wedding that gets hijacked by criminals, hence the play on words title.</p><p>That being said, as you can imagine, Duhamel plays the groom named Tom while his bride, Darcy, is portrayed by Lopez.</p><p>Originally, Duhamel’s role was given to Armie Hammer but after his controversial text messages were exposed and went viral, the actor stepped down and Duhamel was cast as Tom instead.</p><p>As it sounds, it was all for the better because J.Lo. and Duhamel just clicked!</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Fans are super excited to see their chemistry on the big screen but unfortunately, they will have to wait over a year for the movie to be released.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeapMCpecOun5qllaF6qMHSoZysZZ%2BrsrN51qippKGenHq4tdOhZKOdnqO2p7HRZqOoqJWverC6jK6nnKednruoedGopGabn6J6dYSVbWtxZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
