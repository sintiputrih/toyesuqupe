He said that following his previous performance in Brazil, he felt unable to complete his tour dates as scheduled.</p><p>Justin Biber said in his Instagram posting,</p><p>“I went public earlier this year about my fight with Ramsay Hunt syndrome, which left my face mostly paralyzed. As a consequence of my sickness, I was unable to finish the Justice Tour’s North American leg.”</p><p>He went on to say that the trip “had a huge toll” on him. He said that he “gave all” to his performance at Rock in Rio and “to the people of Brazil,” but that he has to take a break and prioritize his health.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Justin-Bieber.jpeg alt="Justin Bieber" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>“After leaving the stage, tiredness seized me, and I understood that I needed to prioritize my health right now. So, for the time being, I’m going to take a vacation from touring. I’ll be well, but I need time to relax and recover.”</p><p>Bieber ended the statement by stating he was honored to “deliver this event and our message of Justice to the globe.” He thanked everyone for their help throughout his experience.</p><p>“Thank you for your prayers and encouragement during this ordeal! I adore each and every one of you!”</p><h2>Justin Bieber canceled numerous tour dates.</h2><p>Due to his bad health, Bieber delayed his tour dates many times earlier this year. The STAY singer halted his tour earlier this year in June after being diagnosed with Ramsay Hunt Syndrome.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Justin-Bieber.jpg alt="Justin Bieber" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The current cancellation will have an impact on 70 performances set for March 2023. Concerts throughout South America, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and Europe are all impacted. The musician has not released any information on his rescheduled shows. However, Justin Bieber’s website still lists tour dates from September 7 to March 25 in 2023. All tickets for the rescheduled dates will be honored, according to the singer’s website, with refunds available at the place of purchase. The singer did not announce when he will be back on stage.</p><h2>Earlier this year, Justin Bieber discussed his Ramsay Hunt Syndrome diagnosis.</h2><p>Justin Bieber uploaded a video earlier this year detailing his experience with Ramsay Hunt Syndrome. The musician is unable to move the paralyzed area of his face or blink his eyes on one side of his face in the video. He was also having difficulty moving the lips on one side of his face. Regarding the video, Bieber stated:</p><p>“So, for those who are disappointed by my cancellations of the upcoming gigs, I’m just not physically capable of doing them. As you can see, this is a terrible situation.”</p><p>He also said that it was becoming more difficult for him to eat, which was quite aggravating. Following his diagnosis, Justin Bieber traveled to Lake Idaho with his wife, Hailey Bieber, as well as his family and friends. He also posted photos from his trip on social media. Usher, an American rapper, and musician who was also there on the trip said that the life of a performer is fraught with stress. The Justice tour is in promotion of Justin Bieber’s newest album, also titled Justice. It was planned to begin in 2021, however owing to Covid constraints, it was pushed back to 2022.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Justin Bieber</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Singer</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGihrquknrtursiemZ6qXZiur6%2FEpZydZZGhuW60yKxksKeiobFuwM6uqWackamytHnTqGSpqpmkv6rAyLOcZqCZqHqpscClq6Fn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
