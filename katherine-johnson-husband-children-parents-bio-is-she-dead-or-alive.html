As a result, Katherine Johnson became a top-notch at Nasa and was mentioned whenever there were math calculations to solve.&nbsp;In 1961, her work helped found the Alan Shepard Freedom 7 Mercury Capsule.&nbsp;She has also proved extremely valuable in her accurate calculations, which have revealed the success of numerous trips by various astronauts to the moon and back.&nbsp;What’s more, she’s one of the minds behind the success of the journey to the planet Mars.</span></p><p><span>What about her contributions to the states thatPresident Barack Obama, former President of the United States of America, presented the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Katherine Johnson on November 24, 2015.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Family – parents, husband and children</span></strong></h2><p><span>Joshua, Katherine’s father, worked as a farmer, while her mother, Joylette, was his support system.&nbsp;Despite the struggles of racism, Joshua and Joylette made sure their children got the best education and helped them get through all the bullies and hard times.</span></p><p><span>After graduating from college, Katherine settled down and married a man named James Francis Globe.&nbsp;With him she had three daughters, Constance, Joylette and Katherine.&nbsp;All three followed in their mother’s footsteps and also became teachers.&nbsp;Over the years, Katherine and James lived together and battled all health challenges together until James died of a brain tumor in 1956.</span></p><p><span>Four years after the death of James FrancisGlobe, Katherine married James A Johnson – a man she had met during her days as a choir member at Carver Memorial Presbyterian.&nbsp;With him she has six grandchildren and eleven great-grandchildren</span></p><h2><strong><span>Is Katherine Johnson dead or alive?</span></strong></h2><p><span>As of the day this article was written, KatherineJohnson is very much alive.&nbsp;Though she’s now over a hundred years old and counting, she’s spent all her days on earth, enjoying much of the fruit she planted during her heyday at NASA.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><span class=vce-square></span><h2 class=entry-title><a href=# title="Who is Cassandra Marino?
