And if she's being honest, she hasn't always been too interested in fashion.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It's really come with the job of being an actor," she tells BAZAAR of her relatively recent interest in clothes.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I directed two films back-to-back this year, and I did the costumes as well, which made me appreciate my friends who are costume designers and all the costume designers I've worked with in the past," Holmes says, speaking of the film Rare Objects and a still-untitled romance movie based in Connecticut. "It made me appreciate silhouettes and cuts and color in a way I thought I had, but when you put it on camera, when you are trying to tell a story, you can see how clothing can do a lot of the work for you."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The actress says storytelling is her true passion, so to have fashion be a part of that and evolve with her throughout her film career has been very rewarding. "And we live in a world where we have a premiere and you want to look nice, and it turns into being a fashion person, and I'm like, 'Well, I just like to look nice, I'm not really a fashion person.' We all just want to look good," she says.</p><img alt="new york, ny 05262022 fashionphile nyc authentication center and showroom launch party pictured katie holmes photo by michael simonstartraksphotocom ms221095editorial rights managed image please contact wwwstartraksphotocom for licensing fee startraks photostartraks photonew york, ny for licensing please call 212 414 9464 or email salesstartraksphotocomimage may not be published in any way that is or might be deemed defamatory, libelous, pornographic, or obscene please consult our sales department for any clarification or question you may havestartraks photo reserves the right to pursue unauthorized users of this image if you violate our intellectual property you may be liable for actual damages, loss of income, and profits you derive from the use of this image, and where appropriate, the cost of collection andor statutory damages" title="FASHIONPHILE NYC Authentication Center And Showroom Launch Party" width=3324 height=2859 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/ms221095-jpg-1654117671.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">MICHAEL SIMON</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In recent weeks, Holmes has been spotted wearing an <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a39310118/katie-holmes-hot-pink-heels-ivory-suit/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="ivory suit with hot pink heels" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">ivory suit with hot pink heels</a>, a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a39998976/katie-holmes-party-look-knit-crop-top-trousers/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="backless knit crop top with wide-leg pants" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">backless knit crop top with wide-leg pants</a>, and a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a39967279/katie-holmes-pda-boyfriend-bobby-wooten-nyc/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="green raincoat with blue trousers" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">green raincoat with blue trousers</a> while out in the city. But she tells BAZAAR that what she feels most at home in is an old tee.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I love my T-shirts, and I love my vintage T-shirts. They're so yummy. They're a little dirty, a little stained or whatever, and that's me," the Coda star says.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It's ironic, really, that the actress known for her elegant style—both on and off the red carpet—would rather hang out in a washed-out tee, but comfort is comfort, and she says giving her clothes a long life is very important to her. That not always means wearing the same clothes over and over again; a lot of the time, it means reselling or donating them, as well as shopping preowned and vintage items.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"We don't have a choice anymore," she says of considering sustainability when she buys clothes and supports new brands. "We have to be smart and conscious, and do the right thing."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Holmes has a personal collection of beloved vintage bags, but she says these days, her most used carryall is a Bottega Veneta. "I feel like that's one of the brands that I always love their pieces, because it's so creative and chic. You feel like you’re wearing a museum piece. So it takes fashion to another level," she says.<br></p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/49ca5303-a74f-4d73-a0f8-6a94e1338358_1714666618.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Rosa Sanchez" title="Headshot of Rosa Sanchez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Rosa Sanchez is the senior news editor at Harper's Bazaar, working on news as it relates to entertainment, fashion, and culture.
