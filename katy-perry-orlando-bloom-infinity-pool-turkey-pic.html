The “Firework” singer took to Instagram to post two drop dead gorgeous photos of her and her fiancé from their epic getaway to Turkey. Posing at the edge of a massive infinity pool, she used the body of water as an analogy for her love: “infinity & beyond,” she simply wrote, adding two heart emojis on either side. The statement is, of course, highly associated with the character Buzz Lightyear from <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Pixar’s Toy Story</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Standing barefoot, Katy kicked her left foot back in the air as she leaned in to kiss the&nbsp;Lord of the Rings&nbsp;alum, who placed his hand sweetly on her waist. In the next, they stood together with their arms around each other, all-smiles as they soaked in the mountains and scenery! Katy looked summer-ready in her gorgeous floral print dress, featuring a wrap style top and shorter sleeves. For his part, Orlando opted for a neutral look with a sand colored t-shirt and a light beige, rolled-up chino.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>The couple have been enjoying their ritzy getaway to Europe, which has included stops in both Greece and Italy. Orlando and Katy’s 10-month-old daughter <strong>Daisy Dove</strong> has also been along for the ride, as has <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Orlando’s son <strong>Flynn</strong></a>, 10, from his previous relationship with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Miranda Kerr</strong></a>. Daisy totally stole the show while the couple toured around Venice in a gondola! The 10-month-old showed her personality during a game of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>peek-a-boo aboard the boat</a>, getting a laugh out of her mom Katy. Flynn also looked like he was having a blast soaking in the history and old buildings that make up the historic Italian city.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Sine getting to Turkey, the engaged duo have kept the romance alive with some much needed alone time. Katy and Orlando were spotted sharing a super steamy kiss as they went for a dip in the ocean, clearly enjoying each other’s company. They looked more in love than ever as they frolicked in the sea, later <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>going for a paddle boarding adventure</a>. The pictures looked like pure bliss as they waded through the ocean, ensuring they stayed covered up from the hot, beating sun.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH14e49tZqSZpK56sbHRq7Bmp6Khrq%2BwzmaZpaefonqqusWipaKsqWK9sLvLZquuqpuaxm68yJxm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
