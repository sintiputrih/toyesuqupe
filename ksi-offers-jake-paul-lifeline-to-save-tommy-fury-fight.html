So lemme give you a lifeline. If you TRULY want to fight Tommy, fight on my card as the co main event.</p><p>“I’ve got everything set up for you. Best believe you owe me though. Ball is in your court. (sic)”</p><p>KSI – whose real name is Olajide Olayinka Williams Olatunji – was replying to a post from a disgruntled Jake, who had tweeted Tommy to insist that he was not going to “weasel” his way out of the match and branded his fellow sports star a “scared little b****”.</p><p>Jake’s tweet read: “Tommy, no matter how hard u try to get out of this fight, I’m going 2 do everything in my power 2 not let u weasel ur way out.</p><p>“My team my partners have made it clear the steps u need to take 2 solve ur latest excuse. Take them or admit ur a scared little b****. #TommyFumbles.(sic)”</p><p>It remains unclear whether the fight will take place as scheduled on August 6 and Tommy – who is the younger brother of boxing legend Tyson Fury – took to Instagram on Monday (27.06.22) to insist he had “no idea” why he was denied entry into the states.</p><p>He said: “Me and my team this morning arrived at Heathrow Airport ready for the press conference, ready to fly out.</p><p>“And as soon as I entered the airport I got pulled to one side and I was told by the Homeland Security officer that was there that my ESTA had been denied and I wasn’t able to travel to the USA for a reason that I apparently know.</p><p>“I have no clue why they would not allow me to travel today and neither does any of my team or my lawyers.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOpKqiZZ%2Bbs6a%2B0mahmqOVYr2iwctmo6KelaG2r7GMraZmq5Grsm7AzqaksmWWqr%2B6ecWinqGsXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
