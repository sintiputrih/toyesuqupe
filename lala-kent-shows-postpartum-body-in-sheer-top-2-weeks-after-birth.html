Thank you Lala for leaving the house for an hour and our beautiful daughter.”</p><p>In the social media upload, the Give Them Lala Beauty creator, 30, sported a sheer black top, camouflage pants and white boots. “Omg she looks amazing after just having a baby,” one Instagram user commented, while another wrote, “How does Lala look like that after giving birth?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Lala-Kent-Shows-Postpartum-Body-in-Sheer-Top-2-Weeks-After-Daughter-Ocean-Birth-2.jpg><p>The<a href=#> Vanderpump Rules</a> stars <a href=#>welcomed their 2-week-old daughter, Ocean</a>, on March 15.

I am so honored to be your mama. My heart could just burst.”</p><p>The Give Them Lala author praised Emmett’s fatherhood skills on Thursday, March 25, writing, “To my love. I’ve been blessed to have you as my partner for the last five years. I didn’t think I could fall any harder for you — then I see you with our daughter. Thank you. Thank you for your unconditional support, thank you for loving me, thank you for giving me Ocean, thank you for it all. I love you.

The news came two years after <a href=#>their engagement</a>.</p><p>While the couple were set to wed in April 2020, <a href=#>they pushed their nuptials back</a> to July of the following year due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>“We are more ready to get married now than we ever were,” Emmett exclusively told Us Weekly in May 2020. “I think we’ve accepted that whatever the version of our wedding day is going to be due to safety protocols … it’s going to be a different world. It’s not going to be what we thought it was going to be, in the sense of a 300-person packed ballroom. We’ve already discussed moving it outdoors to anticipate what the guidelines are going to be like. It’s about becoming one, it’s not about all the other stuff.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGalmZyWeqyxza1krKCfrMBuvM6sq6mZoqnCrnnBqJuyZZmjerS0xJ6pZqyfpXpzedaenKSrXZaztbHRZpmiqqSdfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
