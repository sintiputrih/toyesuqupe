Pfizer plans to submit its data to the Food and Drug Administration “as soon as possible.” Bourla told CNBC, “We plan to submit before Thanksgiving holiday.”</p><p>The antiviral pill made by Merck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">was approved</a>&nbsp;by Britain’s medicines regulator on Thursday.
