That’s not to say&nbsp;<span>Antoine Fuqua’s&nbsp;<span>Kurosawa remake does anything memorably inventive, but this is Wild West action at its most digestible. All the clichés appear – guy gets thrown through window, guy gets shot into casket, multiple guys shoot from the tops of buildings – but it’s never dull or unwatchable. In fact, Fuqua does right to veer towards the realm of camp, which is the only way I can describe&nbsp;<span>Vincent D’Onofrio’s performance. Writers&nbsp;Richard Wenk&nbsp;and&nbsp;Nic Pizzolatto copy from every Western 101 textbook available, and draw up a streamlined hootenanny that allows for more performance-driven success than scripted genius. Seven men, a villain’s army, and one town to protect – easy enough for me.</span></span></span></p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=560 data-current-count=560 data-injectable=true><span><span><span>Frequent Fuqua collaborator Denzel Washington stars as Sam&nbsp;Chisolm, a Kansas Warrant Officer called upon to save the town of Rose Creek from crooked hands. A tyrannical mining mogul,&nbsp;Bartholomew Bogue&nbsp;(<span>Peter Sarsgaard), wants the land for himself, but the newly-widowed Emma Cullen (Haley Bennett) has other ideas for her hometown. It’s Ms. Cullen who gets Chisolm involved, who in turn drafts a collection of wild cards to protect the town of Rose Creek. That, my friends, is the simplicity of The Magnificent Seven, in all its shoot-em-up glory.</span></span></span></span></p><p data-characters=673 data-current-count=673 data-injectable=true>The good news is, with such a focused objective, Fuqua finds plenty of time for gunplay, character wrangling and tons of comedic relief from Chris Pratt (shocker). A few nifty stunts shine through the antique West feel – such as Denzel flipping to one side of his horse and shooting across its back for cover – which keeps action feeling the slightest-bit fresh. Does The Magnificent Seven redefine the Wild West genre as we know it? That couldn’t be farther from the truth. But it does work to create zany period-hokey caricatures&nbsp;who make up a distinguished team of tobacco-spitting vagrants, and boy do they love shootin’ bad guys (like, a lot).</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/4_ChrisPratt.jpg alt=4_chrispratt width=660 height=350 sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p data-characters=304 data-current-count=304 data-injectable=false>As mentioned, the cast is what works here – full-blown showmanship and all. These cowboys can be seen twirling their guns like they’re trying out for a traveling circus and crack really obvious, mostly racist jokes, yet there’s something indulgent about their simple-minded playfulness.</p><p data-characters=448 data-current-count=752 data-injectable=true>D’Onofrio, for instance, sports this super high-pitched voice to counteract his burly man-bear physique. Or there’s Chris Pratt, who kills people with magic and drunkly states the obvious for a quick – but efficient – laugh. Martin Sensmeier, meanwhile, as Comanche Red Harvest, doesn’t even say why he’s joining&nbsp;Chisolm’s primitive Suicide Squad (he makes Chisolm bite a deer heart and that’s it?).</p><p data-characters=507 data-current-count=507 data-injectable=true>So many “WHY!” questions go unanswered, as Fuqua keeps his finger on the pulse of this pulpy, unintentionally-self-aware stupidity that keeps us laughing. Denzel is as steely as ever (boasting a deadly Peacemaker swag), Ethan Hawke buddies&nbsp;with Byung-hun Lee’s supreme knife stills&nbsp;far better than he should and&nbsp;<span>Manuel Garcia-Rulfo is the token Tex-ican (or Mexican he’d say). A melting-pot of devilishness connected by unexpected good intentions (aka money/freedom/retribution).</span></p><p data-characters=408 data-current-count=408 data-injectable=true>Then again,&nbsp;<span>Peter Sarsgaard’s evil role as&nbsp;Bogue&nbsp;goes the “bad guy does bad things” route with tremendous vigor – which, sadly, is rather uninteresting. When you kill everyone and pillage every town, actions become predicable. Haley Bennett does her best as the film’s one female character of note, but again, her lonesome-maiden-with-a-rifle act isn’t necessary new.</span></p><p data-characters=606 data-current-count=606 data-injectable=true><span>One complaint I’ll echo that many others have already is that The Magnificent Seven doesn’t do a blessed thing we haven’t seen some billion times before, and that stagnant belief is what dooms&nbsp;every other grimy-faced character outside the titular seven. Fuqua’s stakes seem low, even with an entire town in the hands of a few capable kinda-nogoodniks. If Westerns aren’t your thing, there’s nothing worth swinging your vote in this cut-and-dry rehashing of&nbsp;better ideas – you’ll be helplessly turned off from the very first glare from under a tilted brim.</span></p><p data-characters=620 data-current-count=620 data-injectable=true>That said, <strong>The Magnificent Seven</strong> is harmless Western fun set to a twangy orchestral score that brings John Wayne and Sergio Leone to mind.&nbsp;Antoine Fuqua enjoys playing around in his Wild West sandbox, smashing&nbsp;toy cowboys together in imaginary brawls. I love my gunslingers&nbsp;cheesy, my duels swift and my horseback riding violent – all things that Fuqua and company deliver. There’s just too much charisma on-screen here to ignore, be it Pratt’s wry alcoholic “jokes” or another one of&nbsp;D’Onofrio’s pitchy prayers – good actors who make&nbsp;weaker, recycled material stick.</p><p data-characters=217 data-current-count=217 data-injectable=false>When all is said and done, the film is&nbsp;mindless entertainment by way of scoundrels, dynamite and honor – not quite magnificent, but “The Watchable Seven” just doesn’t have the same ring to it.</p><span class=icon-star></span><span class=icon-star></span><span class=icon-star></span><span class=icon-star-empty></span><span class=icon-star-empty></span><h5 class=review-rating>Fair</h5><p class=review-summary>The Magnificent Seven is Western "dumb fun," which works just fine with proper expectations.</p><p class=review-title>The Magnificent Seven Review [TIFF 2016]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJopJqfnp6zqq%2FEp6tmq5Wrsq950Z6top2nYsGqssVmaWlpZmQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
