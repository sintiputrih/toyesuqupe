Due to the various filmmakers that have been involved, a lot of conflicting story details have been discussed over time, but We Got This Covered can now confirm exactly who the main villain of the film will be.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=682 data-current-count=682 data-injectable=true>Flash fans won’t be surprised to hear that we’ve been told by our sources – the same ones who said <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taskmaster would be the primary antagonist</a> in&nbsp;Black Widow&nbsp;and that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kevin Conroy was playing Kingdom Come Batman</a> in “Crisis,” both of which turned out to be true – that Reverse-Flash is the current pick to serve as Barry Allen’s nemesis in his first solo movie. Eobard Thawne has been talked about as the antagonist of the piece before, of course, but at least one version of the script featured the Rogues as the villains instead. Muschietti’s take will go with Thawne, however. And Warner Bros. has one big name in mind to play him.</p><p data-characters=521 data-current-count=521 data-injectable=true>As <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">we’ve previously reported</a>, Matthew McConaughey remains the top choice for the role. The Oscar-winning actor was once up for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Two-Face in</a> The Batman,&nbsp;but Matt Reeves ultimately decided to remove that character from his film. WB is still keen to work with him, though, so they might now be planning to shift him over to The Flash&nbsp;instead. At this stage, however, we’re not sure if McConaughey has actually been approached for the part and we’ve been told that they’re eyeing other names as well.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/EMhLGKvW4AA1HFd.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/EMlLVLvW4AAk7ZG.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/EMosmMoXYAIRn0q.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/EMosl1hWkAEkoSN.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/EMp9Rc5XkAEB5Rm.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/EMqAfYtX0AI5KZ-.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/EMqCI65WkAAVf5j.jpeg><p data-characters=390 data-current-count=390 data-injectable=false>Of course, the arrival of Reverse-Flash in the DCEU was already set up in Justice League.&nbsp;In that, we saw Barry speaking with his father Henry Allen in prison, promising that he’ll prove him innocent of killing Barry’s mother, Nora. In the Flashpoint&nbsp;comics storyline, and also explored in The CW’s&nbsp;Flash,&nbsp;it’s Thawn who travelled back in time and murdered Nora.</p><p data-characters=330 data-current-count=720 data-injectable=false><strong>The Flash</strong>&nbsp;was once set to be a direct Flashpoint&nbsp;adaptation itself, but this is unlikely to be the case now. It’ll reportedly still take a couple of cues and plot points from it, though, and once we learn more about WB’s plans for the Scarlet Speedster’s first solo outing, we’ll be sure to let you know.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJopJqhnmLDqrjLmqCnZZahrrS0jKamr6GVYr%2BmvM6rq56cnK56pLvNn6CrpZWZfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
