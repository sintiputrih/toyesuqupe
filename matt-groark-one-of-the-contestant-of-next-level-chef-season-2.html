Each level of the three-story building has a breathtakingly diverse kitchen. The ingredients complement the atmosphere, from the gleaming top floor to the tough depths of the basement, since Gordon Ramsay thinks that the ultimate measure of great chefs is not just what they can achieve in the greatest of conditions, but what sort of magic their can produce in the worst!”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Matt-Groark-2.jpg alt="Matt Groark" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>It also says:</p><p>“The stakes are high as the cooks try to make their initial impressions on their respective teams, with a one-year mentoring and $250,000 on the line.
