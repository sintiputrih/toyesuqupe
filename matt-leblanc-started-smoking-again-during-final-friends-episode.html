And it was this sort of closing of a chapter in all of our lives that was amazing. There’s only five other people on the planet that know what that was like, to have been a part of [it].”</p><p>Friends, which also starred <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Aniston,</strong></a> <strong><a href=#>Courteney Cox,</a><a href=#> Lisa Kudrow</a></strong>, <strong><a href=#>Matthew Perry</a> </strong>and <strong><a href=#>David Schwimmer</a></strong>, aired on NBC from 1994 to 2004. The series has maintained its popularity through multiple networks airing reruns and fans watching the show on Netflix.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“I’ve had people come up to me and say, ‘My mom had cancer and the only thing that lifted her spirits was watching Friends. I went to school abroad and had no friends, you guys were my friends. I got divorced and I thought the world was over, but you guys made me smile,’” LeBlanc said. “I mean I’ve heard all kinds of things like that and to be able to come into people’s lives and make them laugh, I think comedy in a way is humanity’s band aid.”</p><p>Skavlan airs on Fridays in&nbsp;Norway and Sweden.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKSarKRiuaauy5qlnGWjqa6zwMSdZKyln6C2r7OMmp6aoZ5isba%2ByKeeZp6Zo66tecWroJ6mlKh6przIrKadnV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
