She filmed herself talking about this â€˜terrible and horribleâ€™ mugshot â€“ this is how she called it.</p><p>The Shade Room posted about this and explained to readers whatâ€™s her mugshot all about.</p><p>Megan hopped online to explain the situation between her and an ex-boyfriend she had when she was 19.</p><p>TSR writes that Megan â€˜was at #SXSW, and found out that same day that her man cheated on her AND fathered a child with a woman he claimed to have slept with only one time. Apparently, when Megan found out, they began arguing, and the dispute turned violent.â€™</p><p>She also said that the argument took place into the street, and people called the police.</p><p>â€˜Unfortunately for her, when she began to swing at him, cops stopped her in her tracks and had more than enough evidence to lock her up!â€™ TSR wrote.</p><p>People are really supportive of Meg in the comments.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B8ceXR5h9fK/</p><p>Someone said: â€˜Yâ€™all troll anything I like how she did that even though she doesnâ€™t owe anybody an explanation!â€™ and another follower posted this: â€˜Man, she can tell a story!! Iâ€™m engaged as HELL!!! ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³ I see why sheâ€™s such a good rapper!!! Lol.â€™</p><p>Someone else wrote: â€˜Once you become a celebrity they find EVERYTHING. Thatâ€™s why I want a job behind the scenes.â€™</p><p>Another commenter posted: â€˜Our men donâ€™t protect us as we do them smh,â€™ and a fan said: â€˜The fact that her old mugshot even surfaced is wack. People always want to assassinate someoneâ€™s character when theyâ€™re successful.â€™</p><p>One other person wrote: â€˜I feel like I was sitting there with her as she was saying this ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ Iâ€™m all engaged.â€™</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>You are probably aware of the fact that Meg was recently in the spotlight when <a href=#>she sparked romance rumors with G-Eazy.&nbsp;</a></p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGedmrSiuoytn56dXajBorjLoqanZZGZsbOx0qycrGWYmr9uwMSrqaKanJp6qbvRq6CbpJViuraz0qGmrWWWp7yuecGamqRlmaN6c3yQbmRsbmhqg3F7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
