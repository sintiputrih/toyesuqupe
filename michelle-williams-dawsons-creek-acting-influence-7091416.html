She even mentioned the beloved series during her acceptance speech at the&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Gotham Awards</a>&nbsp;last year.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While many people would be quick to brush off the show as nothing but a soapy teen drama, Williams mentioned that she learned a lot about the intricacies of acting on the series, which also starred Katie Holmes, Joshua Jackson, and James Van Der Beek.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Maybe there’s a connection between firstness and lastness, so I’m constantly reconnecting with my time on&nbsp;Dawson’s Creek&nbsp;because every project that I end somehow recalls that to me,” Williams told The&nbsp;New York Times. “But it was an incredible kind of training because you’re also learning these really fundamental things, like how to have a conversation with somebody where you’re looking them in the eye but some part of you is also scanning downward to hit your mark. It’s that kind of technical stuff that seems sort of silly and small that still comes in handy for me.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Williams also mentioned that the show's greuling production schedule taught her a lot about discipline and work ethic. Of course, post-Dawson's Creek, she starred in similarly tear-jerking projects like&nbsp;Brokeback Mountain,&nbsp;Blue Valentine,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Manchester by the Sea.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“So much dialogue, oh my god,” she said about the&nbsp;Dawson's Creek&nbsp;scripts, which were&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>famously lambasted</a>&nbsp;by just about every TV critic in the '00s. “Twelve pages a day, really verbose.”&nbsp;<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zKKaoZ2cobJuw8ilo6KZnah6pa3WrKanq12Yv6axymaYnKyZo7Rutc2fo66dnpiyboOPcmhtaWY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
