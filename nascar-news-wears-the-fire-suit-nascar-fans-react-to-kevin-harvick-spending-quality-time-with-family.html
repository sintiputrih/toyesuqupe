Obviously, some drivers are a little bored out of their skulls with little to no racing action. However, there are others who have taken advantage of the off-season to spend time with their families. Stewart-Haas Racing driver Kevin Harvick definitely falls in the latter category.</p><p>Recently, he <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>posted</a> some pictures on social media of himself hanging out with his family. This included his two children, Keelan and Piper, and his wife, DeLana. Keelan is already an active racer, but it appears that little Piper may soon follow her older brother and father.</p><a href=# class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b transparent-card"><img id="img-tag-nascar-news-why-does-kevin-harvicks-wife-delana-harvick-wear-a-firesuit-on-the-racetrack-despite-not-being-a-nascar-driver?utm_campaign=internal_links&utm_medium=dive_deeper&utm_source=website-embed-image" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/7cb85d1abb8a6ccefb875ac1c34bee4f-467x315.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b card-content">Why does Kevin Harvick’s Wife DeLana Harvick Wear a Firesuit on the Racetrack Despite Not Being a NASCAR Driver?</p></a><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>How did NASCAR fans react to Kevin Harvick being with his family?</h2><p>A lot of fans were happy to see the <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Harvick</a> family spending time together. Some noted that DeLana was conspicuously missing from the photographs. Naturally, they wanted to know her reaction to having her daughter expressed an interest in racing. People also wondered whether DeLana Harvick managed to suit up and go for a drive.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I noticed Mama D wasn't around, how is DeLana handling that fact that Piper G is taking interest in racing?</p><p>— Benny (@bebop_73) <a href=#>December 5, 2022</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Where is mom at?

All this was in spite of her not being a racing driver and instead focusing on the business aspect. As a result, NASCAR fans wanted to know if Piper Harvick was going to be known as the girl in the fire suit.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Piper wears the firesuit in the family now haha</p><p>— Brandon Ellinger (@EllingerBrandon) <a href=#>December 5, 2022</a></p><p>One thing is for sure, several NASCAR fans are eager to see Keelan and Piper carry on the family tradition. As mentioned before, the older sibling is already an active racer. Meanwhile, his sister is just content with taking baby steps and may soon try to try her hand at motor racing.</p><p><strong>WATCH THIS STORY:&nbsp;</strong><span><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>“These guys race that way” – Kevin Harvick and William Byron Join in as Chase Elliott Curses Ross Chastain</a></span></p><p>As for Kevin Harvick himself, he is just going to enjoy some time off with his family, celebrating Christmas and New Year’s Day.
