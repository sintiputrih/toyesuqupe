Prince) described Youngboy as a “dumb boy with limited thinking ability,” who took his “kindness for weakness.”</p><p>The Rap-A-Lot CEO fired the verbal shots at Youngboy in a video he uploaded to his Instagram yesterday, titled “A MESSAGE TO DUMB BOY.”</p><p>J. Prince <a href=#>says in the video</a>:</p><p>“You’re a dumb boy with limited thinking ability and disrespectful. Acting like you and your brother wasn’t down with me and letting it be known that you was mob ties…</p><p>What you should be mad about is the lie you’re living and the weak-ass security being sleep in front of your house.”</p>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A post shared by J Prince (@jprincerespect)</a> on Jun 23, 2020 at 12:52pm PDT</p><h2>Youngboy told J. Prince to “mind his business”</h2><p>The tongue-lashing statement on Instagram was in response to <a href=#>rapper Youngboy</a>&nbsp;saying that J. Prince should “mind his f**k**g business” after burglars <a href=#>broke into Youngboy’s home</a> last week and stole some of the rapper’s stuff.</p><p>The music executive got in touch with the culprits and then uploaded a video to let Youngboy and everyone know that he had found Youngboy’s missing stuff, including the keys to his Rolls Royce and McLaren.</p><p>“Lil homie Youngboy place got broke into. People went in his place, disrespected different things, and… I got a call about it.</p><p>And the lil homies that went into this place wanna make that right… I got your keys to your Rolls Royce. I got your keys to your McLaren.”</p><p><a href=#>NBA Youngboy</a> did not appreciate J. Prince making a public statement about his personal affairs through a video uploaded online.</p><p>He <a href=#>uploaded a video</a> in which he told J. Prince that he did not appreciate the publicity and that <a href=#>he should mind his business</a>:</p><p>“It’s plenty ways to get in touch with me. Man, don’t get on no internet and do no publicly… None of that p***y **s s**t… Mind your f**king business, man.”</p><h2>J. Prince answered that he was minding his business</h2><p>J. Prince concluded his response to <a href=#>Youngboy Never Broke Again</a> by initially striking a guardedly conciliatory tone: he said he did not consider Youngboy a friend or an enemy despite what had happened and that he would like to keep it that way.</p><p>However, he ended his statement by saying that he was minding his business when he contacted the criminals and recovered Youngboy’s stuff.</p><p>“By the way, I’m minding my business. You just too dumb to know Texas is my business and I will give you whatever you ask for. Good or bad.”</p><p>J. Prince is a well-known music promoter and CEO of Rap-A-Lot, a hip-hop record label based in Houston, Texas. He also previously managed top professional boxers, including Floyd Mayweather Jr.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6cnKWdkqe2tcWOp5maZamkwq%2BzwaiwZq6jYrduvNGipZydXaGutbHSrWSrmaBirm64zq1knJ2fYsCixdJmrZqkpZavrbGMqZiipl2nrrG8xKtkoqtdmcKuroybprJlp57BqXnLoqSirJWZerW0yKeioqaXYq6jtcuiq7Jn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
