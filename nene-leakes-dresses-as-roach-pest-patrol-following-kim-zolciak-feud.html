While Biermann and &nbsp;Zolciak never publicly shared the video, NeNe posted a photo on Instagram on Thursday, October 5, saying she was going to “live in my ROACH infested brand new home.” Shortly after, she posted Biermann’s video to her Instagram account, calling her “racist” as well as slamming Zolciak for being a “trashy mom.”</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“We don’t have roaches!
