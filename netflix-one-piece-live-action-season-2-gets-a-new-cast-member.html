She is an archaeologist of the Straw Hat Pirate Crew, having the powers of &nbsp;Hana Hana Devil Fruit, which allows her to regenerate any parts of her body or the entire body. In One Piece, the character also caters to the role of a mother for the crew because of her calm and collected demeanor, which necessitates the casting of someone mature in Netflix’s One Piece Live Action Season 2.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/One-Piece-Live-Action-Season-2-1.jpg><p>Netflix has done a brilliant job with casting in One Piece Live Action Season 1 and has been praised well by the fandom.
