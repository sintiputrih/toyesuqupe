That’s what I tell myself.”</p><p>Us Weekly reported on Thursday, May 13, that Mulaney had moved on with the Oklahoma native. Less than one week prior, the stand-up comedian <a href=#>announced his split from wife <strong>Anna Marie Tendler</strong></a> after six years of marriage.</p><p>“I am <a href=#>heartbroken</a> that John has decided to end our marriage,” Tendler, 35, said in a statement on Monday, May 10. “I wish him support and success as he continues his recovery.”</p><p>At the time, a spokesperson for the Oh, Hello actor told Us, “John will not have any further comment as he continues to focus on his recovery and getting back to work.”</p><p>News of Mulaney’s divorce came <a href=#>shortly after he left a 60-day rehab program</a> in February. The Big Mouth star voluntarily checked into a treatment center in Pennsylvania in December 2020 for alcohol and cocaine addiction. A source told Us at the time that <a href=#>the move “was a relief” to his loved ones</a>.</p><p>“It was John’s decision. Plain and simple, John had too much downtime [in quarantine]. He had too much time in his own head,” the insider explained, claiming that choosing to seek treatment “saved his life” after an “ugly” relapse.</p><p>Before recently falling off the wagon, <a href=#>Mulaney had been sober</a> for over a decade. “I drank for attention,” he told Esquire in September 2019. “I was really outgoing, and then at 12, I wasn’t. I didn’t know how to act. And then I was drinking, and I was hilarious again.”</p><p>While the Chicago native said he “never liked smoking pot,” he “loved” cocaine. At 23, he quit abusing substances cold-turkey following a major “bender” in the mid-2000s.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“It was just crazy. A weekend that was … there were … I’m never going to tell you. That’s mine,” he said in his Esquire profile. “I didn’t kill anyone or assault anyone. But yeah, I was like, ‘You’re f–king out of control.’ And I thought to myself, ‘I don’t like this guy anymore. I’m not rooting for him.'”</p><p>When the Comeback Kid performer <a href=#>checked into rehab last year</a>, Munn was one of several followers to reach out. “Sending SO MUCH love and support to John Mulaney. You got this,” she tweeted in December.</p><p>Us confirmed four months earlier that the Ride Along 2 actress <a href=#>split from boyfriend <strong>Tucker Roberts</strong> </a>after more than one year together. She previously dated <a href=#><strong>Aaron Rodgers</strong></a> from 2014 to 2017.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaopJmrtqJ5zK6lp2WjpHqwrtKeqqydlGLEqsDHZqGooJ5iura4wKecsmWSmrOwvsRmm5qsmaO0cA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
