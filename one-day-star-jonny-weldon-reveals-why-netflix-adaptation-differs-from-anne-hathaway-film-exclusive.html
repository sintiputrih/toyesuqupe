So in that sense, it's going to be reflective of reading the book in the sense that every year passes as in the chapter, every year passes with an episode as well, which is different to the movie… They obviously felt that was right to change the lengths of it and stay true to the way they see the characters' journeys going.”&nbsp;</p><p id=e2eSHXVh3XY data-wc=43>In the show, This is Going to Hurt star Ambika Mod and The White Lotus actor Leo Woodall take over the roles as Emma Morley and Dexter Mayhew respectively, and Jonny opened up about the joy of playing Emma’s boyfriend in the show.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ba92145be93b-od106unit00153trl1.jpg><p id=ewGwVGxrpp5K data-wc=26>“Ambika’s wonderful.

The synopsis reads: “One Day tells the story of Emma Morley and Dexter Mayhew who, on 15th July 1988, the night of their graduation, speak for the very first time. The next morning, they go their separate ways but where will they be on this one ordinary day the next year, and the year after that, and every year that follows?</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Netflix's swoony-worthy drama One Day finally drops gripping first trailer" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/8c72c7f61333-oneday-firstlook.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Netflix's swoony-worthy drama One Day finally drops gripping first trailer" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Netflix's swoony-worthy drama One Day finally drops gripping first trailer</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="I'm a TV superfan and these are my absolute must-watches for 2024" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/87dfbe8bce8a-tv-2024.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="I'm a TV superfan and these are my absolute must-watches for 2024" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>I'm a TV superfan and these are my absolute must-watches for 2024</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Gladiator 2: everything you need to know from cast to first trailer" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/8ba20b1c87a6-gl205931rc2.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Gladiator 2: everything you need to know from cast to first trailer" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Gladiator 2: everything you need to know from cast to first trailer</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=eM0EOyU1Ckt9 data-wc=27>“Each episode finds Dex and Em, one year older, on this one particular date, as they grow and change, move together and apart, experience joy and heartbreak.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4ec44018dbd8-sturgess-hathaway-2.jpg><p id=eYUtJQJ_FGKt data-wc=76>Speaking about why viewers will love the show, Jonny added: “What Emma and Dexter go through is what all people go through. It's about first love. It's about growing up. It's about experiencing the world. It's about loss. It's about so many collective universal things. It's very real. Most people I'd say have an Em or a Dexter in their lives. So it's hugely relatable, and I think as well there's something very British about it.”&nbsp;</p><p id=eRAL96-4Io data-wc=10><strong></strong><br></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
