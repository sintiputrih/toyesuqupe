On top of that, many fans wanted to know what <a href=#>content adults could enjoy on Disney+</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not long after people started talking about the classic content that was going to be available on Disney+, the conversations started to revolve more around original content. After all, it is virtually impossible for streaming services to succeed these days if they aren't the home of popular original content.</p><p>On the bright side, there has been some Disney+ original programming that people have paid a lot of attention to including <a href=#>the upcoming Daredevil series</a>. On the other hand, there is no doubt that a lot of Disney+'s original programming has been completely ignored.</p><p>Fortunately for the people behind the original movie Prom Pact, there very clearly is a lot of interest in that film. In fact, some fans are so excited about Prom Pact that they've become very interested in if the movie's stars, Peyton Elizabeth Lee And Milo Manheim, are a couple in real life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-fans-think-peyton-elizabeth-lee-and-milo-manheim-are-dating>Why Fans Think Peyton Elizabeth Lee And Milo Manheim Are Dating</h2><p>Throughout Disney's history, the company has always wanted to seem like it is family-friendly. With that in mind, it makes perfect sense that it has always seemed like Disney wants the public to think that the stars that appear in Disney media always get along.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/peyton-elizabeth-lee-and-milo-manheim-on-the-red-carpet.jpg><p>Of course, it should go without saying that it is extremely common for co-workers to not get along. As a result, it shouldn't surprise anyone that in the past, many Disney stars have revealed that they actually couldn't stand their co-stars.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>15 Disney Stars Who Couldn't Stand Working With Each Other</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the bright side for fans who want to feel like most Disney stars get along with their co-workers, that often seems to be the case. In fact, the many examples of former Disney stars who've recently launched rewatch podcasts together prove how long a lot of those connections have lasted. A perfect example of that is the lovable connection the hosts of Pod Meets World still seem to share.</p><p>Still, there is no doubt that the bonds some Disney stars share seem to be a little bit special. According to many Disney fans who've been watching Peyton Elizabeth Lee And Milo Manheim's relationship from afar, they are a perfect example of that.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/peyton-elizabeth-lee-and-milo-manheim-in-prom-pact.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since they were cast in Prom Pact together, a lot of fans have noticed that Lee and Manheim seem to share a truly special bond. After all, there is absolutely no doubt that Manheim and Lee have both posted images of the two of them looking extremely cozy together on social media.</p><p>Despite the way those photos of Lee and Manheim make it seem the two actors love to embrace, it is worth noting that some people have an intimate relationship like that with their friends. That said, there have been some other indications that Manheim and Lee may be more than friends.</p><p>When there was a movie premiere for Manheim's movie Zombies 3, many fans took note of the fact that Lee was there to support Milo. As cool as it was to see Lee support Manheim like that, it was what happened when Lee posted about that event on social media that caught a lot of people's eyes.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Peyton Elizabeth Lee Landed Her 'Doogie Kamealoha, M.D.' Role</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After attending the Zombies 3 premiere, Lee posted images and photos from the event on Instagram. In response to Lee's post, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Manheim commented "My zombae"</a> which left many fans believing that was an indication that the two young actors may be a couple.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/peyton-elizabeth-lee-and-milo-manheim-at-the-zombies-3-red-carpet.jpg><p>While there is no doubt that Manheim's comment didn't confirm a relationship, fans were very interested that he referred to Lee as his bae in any context.</p><p>Finally, there is one other thing that fans think may indicate that Manheim and Lee are more than friends.</p><p>Back when Lee was starring in the show Andi Mack, she consistently worked with another young actor named Asher Angel. While those two young actors were co-stars, some fans came to believe that they were a couple, similar to the situation with Lee and Manheim.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During that era in her career, Lee attended the 2017 Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards where she was asked about her relationship with Angel. In response, Lee made it very clear that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her relationship with Angel wasn't romantic</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/peyton-elizabeth-lee-and-asher-angel-on-the-red-carpet.jpg><p>“Actually, we’re all just best friends. Asher’s like my best friend in the whole world. He is really like my brother."</p><p>Since Lee hasn't said anything like that about Manheim, some observers see that as a possible indication that they could be a couple.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-peyton-elizabeth-lee-and-milo-manheim-may-not-be-dating>Why Peyton Elizabeth Lee And Milo Manheim May Not Be Dating</h2><p>When fans are looking for reasons to think that two stars they ship could be involved, they sometimes make connections that simply aren't there. Considering the way some fans have interpreted the fact that Peyton Elizabeth Lee hasn't denied dating Milo Manheim the way she once did with Asher Angel, that could be an example of that.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Disney Channel Stars You Forgot Dated In Real Life</a></span></p><p>Just because someone expressly denied dating one person and not another, that doesn't mean that they must be dating the second person. On top of that, it is worth noting that Lee only denied dating Angel after she was specifically asked about the rumors in a situation where it would be awkward to avoid the question.</p><p>On top of the reasons to believe the pieces of evidence that some fans think may indicate Lee and Manheim are a couple, there are two more noteworthy things to consider.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>First off, unless Lee and Manheim one day confirm they are dating or at the very least "inside sources" do, there is nothing more than conjecture about their relationship. Secondly, it seems pretty obvious that if Lee and Manheim wanted to make the nature of their relationship clear, one of them would confirm or deny the rumors.</p><p>At the end of the day, it may not be very satisfying, but the truth remains that is unclear if Lee and Manheim have a romantic connection.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGinnrGkpLtuscuisZqalam1brjEnmSappRiuqq4zmakmqaYmrauv4yrnKWZpJ68r7%2FHoqdmnJGptq%2Bzjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
