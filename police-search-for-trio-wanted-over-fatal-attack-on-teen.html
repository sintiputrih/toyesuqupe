Police believe he will have visible injuries to the left side of his face.</p><p>Homicide Squad Detective Inspector Andrew Stamper said from the information police have so far, the assault appears to have occurred without provocation.</p><p>“Our investigators have been working hard to identify the trio we believe are involved, but we now need further information from the public,” Detective Inspector Stamper said.</p><p>“There are people in the community who will know who was involved and who will have information that can help; we urge you to come forward with any details.</p><p>“I can’t even imagine what the Langhans family must be going through, to find out that your son and much-loved brother, who just went out to a party, will no longer be coming home.</p><p>“To the friends or guests who chased the trio away, who would have been just trying to look out for their friend, we’d like to hear from you to help establish the circumstances of what occurred and you may be able to help us find the weapon involved.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.19%2C$multiply_0.3541%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_57/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/40f4739d40b2d08318fbaaf2828414a5279e533b><p>“These men need to be held to account for their actions.”</p><p>Mr Langhan’s mother, Carolyn, said she and Jason’s father, Paul, had watched their son take his last breath on Saturday.</p><p>“Jason you were our whole life and not a day will go by without us thinking about you and wishing you were here, we love you so much and our lives feel so empty,” she wrote in a public tribute on social media.</p><p>“You put up a good fight but unfortunately it was your time to go and now you’re no longer in any pain.”</p><p>Friend Jason Canal said he was in disbelief that his mate was gone.</p><p>“RIP Jason, I’m lost for words … it kills me to hear that you aren’t here with us anymore and that we can’t go fishing together like we always talked about,” he posted on social media.</p><p>“My heart’s aching [at the moment] and I’m in so much disbelief, it’s so unfair what’s happened. I love you heaps, fly high brother.”</p><p><strong>Anyone with information is urged to call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000</strong></p><h3>Start your day informed</h3><p>Our Morning Edition newsletter is a curated guide to the most important and interesting stories, analysis and insights.
