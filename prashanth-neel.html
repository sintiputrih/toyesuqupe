After finishing the training, he opted to cast his brother-in-law, actor Srimurali, in Aa Hudugi Neene, a script he wrote at the time.

The sequel, KGF Chapter 2, was supposed to be released in theaters on July 16, 2021, however, it was pushed back owing to the second wave of the COVID epidemic in India.
