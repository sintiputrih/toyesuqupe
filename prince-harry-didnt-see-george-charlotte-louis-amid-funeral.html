A source exclusively revealed to Us before his return that <a href=#><strong>Meghan Markle</strong></a>, who is <a href=#>expecting the couple’s second child</a>, <a href=#>could not travel “on doctor’s orders”</a> because she was “too far along to fly and it’s recommended she rest in the final months.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Prince-Harry-Didnt-See-George-Charlotte-Louis-While-UK-Funeral-001.jpg><p>As such, Harry attended the service without the former actress, 39.

After the memorial, Harry, William and Kate, 39, were spotted <a href=#>talking as they left the chapel</a>.</p><p>Body language expert <strong>Elaine Swann</strong> exclusively told Us earlier this week that the brothers appeared to be <a href=#>“at ease” with each other as they walked with Kate</a>.</p><p>“I believe there was some sort of connection and conversation or something beforehand — that was not the first time those <a href=#>two brothers had a conversation</a> with one another,” Swann said on Monday, April 19. “I cannot imagine those two brothers starting in that line and that [funeral] procession — going through what they went through as brothers and being as thick as thieves as they said before — and not speaking to one another until after the service.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Royal expert <strong>Katie Nicoll</strong> predicted that <a href=#>Kate played “peacemaker”</a> between the duo. “They were very tense as they walked into that chapel,” she told Entertainment Tonight on Monday. “As they came out of it, you could see some tension diffused.”</p><p>Although Meghan and son <a href=#>Archie</a>, 23 months, could not make the trip, Us confirmed that she <a href=#>sent a personalized note and a wreath of flowers</a> for the funeral.
