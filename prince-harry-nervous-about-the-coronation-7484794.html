Now that everyone knows that&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Prince Harry</a>&nbsp;will make the trip across the Atlantic to see his pops take the throne, he's apparently apprehensive about the whole ordeal, which could see him taking attention away from the pomp and circumstance of Charles and Camilla's big day. It's something he's aware of and according to royal expert Nick Bullen, the family is very aware of it all, too.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I think he’ll be nervous about how the family [will] react to him, and I think it’s pretty clear that he’s gonna minimize the amount of time that he’s in London,” Bullen told&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Us Weekly</a>. “He’s already said that he wants to be back for Archie’s birthday that afternoon, that evening ... It will be very much of a fly-in visit. Harry isn’t part of the procession or the balcony appearance.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Just a recap for anyone who's behind (understandable): Prince William and Harry are still not on speaking terms — allegedly.&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Prince Charles and Harry are talking</a>, obviously, and the king wants his progeny to get along, like any dad would. Meghan Markle is staying home to celebrate her son Archie's birthday and Kate Middleton is, apparently, just unbothered and keeping her signature smile on her face.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Insiders added that Meghan would never have missed Archie's birthday, even for a coronation. Sources said that she sees herself as a mother first and that those duties supersede anything and everything at Buckingham Palace (or Westminster Abbey).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“As much as Meghan appreciates the invite to the coronation, she wouldn’t miss her son’s birthday for the world. Despite being the Duchess of Sussex, Meghan is a mom first,” an insider said. “She feels very grateful to be included in such a special occasion by the royal family and is glad that Harry can go and show support on behalf of their family. But being the same day as Archie’s birthday, unfortunately, she’s just going to have to miss out on this one.”<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57z6ugp5uVYrWivtGyZKedoqu8tr%2BMmpmoraRiwamxjJymq6eelsGqu81mbm1wZGyGdQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
