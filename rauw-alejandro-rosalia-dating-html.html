The rumors about them going out with one another have been circulating since late 2020.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>They are yet to come out with an official confirmation. But, that doesn’t mean the internet stops gathering hints about them from various places.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Here are the few times the Puerto Rican rapper and the Spanish <a href=# rel=follow>singer</a> have ignited or added fuel to the fire about their dating speculations. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Rumors and Hints</h2><p>Alejandro&nbsp;and Rosalia have a connection that predates their dating rumors. While <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">talking to Cosmopolitan</a> in&nbsp;June 2021, Alejandro admitted he had a great friendship with her. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>He said in the interview that they had been exchanging ideas and working on her projects lately, revealing great chemistry in the studio. They also&nbsp;collaborated on his debut album, Afrodisíaco, which came out in November 2020.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Further, he also heaped praise on Rosalia as a musical artist, saying, “For me, she is the top. Not only in Spain but also worldwide. She is extremely talented.” <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, around the time his album came out — about a month earlier, to be exact&nbsp;—&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">their dating rumors</a> started. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>On October 27, 2020, Rosalia posted a picture on her Instagram and Twitter. She was&nbsp;seen sitting on a staircase holding a bouquet of red roses. In the caption, she thanked the seemingly anonymous sender of those flowers.</p><p>But, it seemed like Alejandro couldn’t keep himself from commenting on the picture on both platforms. And he did, sending a clear message as to who sent those lovely things her way. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>This prompted eagle-eyed fans to keep track of their every move on social media. And thus came up a lot of hints about their possible relationship.</p><p>More than a couple of times,&nbsp;fans saw them with matching clothes on the internet. And not just clothes, but also matching kitchen decor and shoes.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Initially, people thought they were subtly hinting at a collaboration. But those speculations didn’t turn into anything concrete. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Nevertheless,&nbsp;the rumors&nbsp;continued when Rosalia posted Alejandro's Instagram pictures on her stories a while ago, sending fans into a frenzy and seemingly confirming that there is something between them.</p><h2>Messages Get Clear</h2><p>Despite the apparent hints on social media, there was yet to be an official confirmation. And Alejandro addressed his connections to Rosalia, as well as Ester Exposito, during an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview with El Mundo</a>.</p><p>He laughed before answering the query from the interviewer. But then he got serious and responded, saying that&nbsp;what he had with Rosalia was a “good relationship” and just musical.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>"Can’t I have friends? Can’t I have a good time for a while?" said the Puerto Rican, seemingly dismissing the rumors and implying he was single.</p><p>But, the latest developments seem to have spilled water on his ruse, if he said what he said, to deflect any further rumors. On August 19, 2021, the duo was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">seen together in LA</a>. And this marks the first time they’ve been spotted together in public.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The pair were pictured them leaving The Nice Guy, a popular celebrity night out spot, with his hand on hers. What’s interesting is, they didn’t try to hide their intimacy or come out separately or even not hold hands.</p><p>So, does this public outing confirm that they're officially boyfriend and girlfriend? Everybody seems to think so. But, there’s always the possibility that they’re just REALLY good friends. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKqRqsRurcueoZqmlKe8br7OrJiloZFisaLAyKeeZ6Ckork%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
