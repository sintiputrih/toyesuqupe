"I'm 21 now, so she [Toya Johnson] was like, 'I can't tell you what to do. You look perfect the way you are, but it's whatever you want to do.' So I finally got to do it, and I'm so excited about it," Carter said.</p><p>Carter was clear that her decision to get breast implants was not born from insecurities or societal pressure, it was just something she wanted to do for herself and no one else. She also acknowledged that, while it may be a controversial move, she isn't too concerned with other people's opinions.&nbsp;"Nobody pressured me. Nobody told me to do this. I feel like I didn't have society telling me this. I feel like it's self-love," Carter said. "I love myself. I loved myself before the boobs, and I love myself after. I don't care what people have to say."</p><p>The rising star said she has "always been comfortable" in her own skin and attributes much of that confidence to <a href=#>her father, rapper Lil Wayne</a>.&nbsp;"My father always made sure that I was told that I was beautiful," she said. "So growing up, I always had that mentality: I'm pretty, I'm beautiful."&nbsp;Her confidence is truly admirable and fans flooded her first <a href=#>post</a> since the surgery with love and support.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma3BkZX90e9GenqKmkZp6pK3RrZyrq12pv6K60p%2Bmq6WRqbawuoyiqmaspae7qrrGZp%2BemZSofA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
