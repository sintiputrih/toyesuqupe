Glanville originally blamed Rimes for the actor’s infidelity, claiming the songwriter was obsessed with her then-husband.</p><p>“LeAnn is a stalker,”&nbsp;the Bravo personality&nbsp;told Us Weekly&nbsp;at the time. “She refuses to leave us alone — it is shameful and scary. People are going to say it takes two to tango and I get that, but at some point LeAnn needs to stop asking him to dance.”</p><p>Glanville’s&nbsp;stalking allegations came shortly before news broke of the Country Comfort star’s affair with <a href=#>Vanderpump Rules</a> star <a href=#><strong>Schaena Shay</strong></a>.&nbsp;<a href=#>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</a> alum filed for divorce from Cibrian in 2010.</p><p>“Eddie and I have decided to take some time apart,” Glanville told Us. “I want to do what is best for our children [Mason and Jake]. Eddie and LeAnn deserve each other.”</p><p>Cibrian and the Grammy winner tied the knot in 2011. When the “I Need You” singer was <a href=#>hospitalized in December 2012</a> for extreme anxiety, Glanville predicted the couple would likely divorce within the next 10 years.</p><p>“I think when the 10-year mark [of their marriage] comes and he leaves her and takes half her stuff, we’ll all be good together because they won’t even be related,” the reality star&nbsp;claimed during an interview with Daily Pop. “If she doesn’t have a kid with him, then we don’t ever have to see her again.”</p><p>A series of back-and-forth allegations sprang from both camps following the <a href=#>Celebrity Big Brother</a> contestant’s interview before the feud fizzled out in 2018.</p><p>“The three of us sat and talked for hours [and] hashed everything out and the feud with @leannrimes Eddie and I is over” Glanville tweeted in April 2018. They will not be getting rid of me on any holidays #modernfamily.”</p><p>Four years later,&nbsp;Rimes confirmed that she and Glanville <a href=#>are still on good terms</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Oh, I love her! I mean I do. I love her. We get along very well. She’s fun. We have a great time at all the holidays,” Rimes told Us at the 2022 CMT Music Awards. “We are connected through the boys and we have great respect for one another.”</p><p>Scroll down to see how these three went from feuding to family:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkv6bCyKygrWWSp66vsMhmnqWZnqu2rbjErGSfnaWZeri106FknpyUnrJur8ibqaKZnmK5pq3Np2SroZ2awHCt1KCsrKxdZ31yfo4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
