Here's a roundup of the best.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>In case you missed it, <a href=#>Nick Cannon</a> decided to try to pick a fight with rapper <a href=#>Eminem</a>, and it's not going so well for him. The beef started when Eminem released a new song that made another dig at his past relationship with Mariah Carey (the two only dated for six months in 2001, and Mariah claims it never even happened).&nbsp;</p><p>Well, Nick, who was married to Mariah from 2008 to 2016, wasn't a huge fan of that. Nick and Mariah are still on good terms, and they co-parent their children together still.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The #RIPNickCannon memes are hilarious.</h2><p>In response to Eminem's diss to Mariah, Nick released a diss track of his own ‚Äî and let's just say he's clearly not winning.</p><p>Twitter thought his track was hilariously awful, and in response, there have been more than a few <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"#RIPNickCannon" memes</a> gaining traction on the site. Here's a roundup of the best memes from their fight.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>A rare pic of me listening to Nick's diss track<a href=#>#ripnickcannon</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/hMZN5Y7QKZ</a></p>‚Äî Fer Rouq (@SocialOutcast47) <a href=#>December 10, 2019</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The hashtag #RIPNickCannon started trending on Twitter.</h2><p>In what's probably the biggest diss to Nick, Eminem fans started tweeting with the hashtag #RIPNickCannon, making fun of his track. And since it's the internet, no one's holding back.&nbsp;</p><p>One user tweeted, "A rare pic of me listening to Nick's diss track," showing someone sitting next to a garbage can with headphones leading into it. Another tweeted,&nbsp;"Nick Cannon waking up and seeing #ripnickcannon trending after he thought he shut Eminem down with a diss track," captioning a video of a little boy throwing a fit.</p><p>Clearly, Eminem's got a lot more people on his side than Nick ever expected him to. We're also a little surprised at the support shown for him, since he hasn't been too popular lately.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Nick Cannon waking up and seeing <a href=#>#ripnickcannon</a> trending after he thought he shut Eminem down with a diss track. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/1IgajUkoHl</a></p>‚Äî Ladyday13 (@Ladyday132) <a href=#>December 10, 2019</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Someone started a GoFundMe to donate to Nick's funeral.</h2><p>Another user tweeted a screenshot of a GoFundMe that was set up for "Nick Cannon's Career Funeral," asking for a goal of only $1. The caption on the GoFundMe page reads, "On Dec. 9, 2019, Actor Nick Cannon made the most trashiest diss track in the history of mankind. Today, we mourn the loss of his career because it is going down the f--king drain. So please send your best dime..... which don't cost much.
