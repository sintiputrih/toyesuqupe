Paevey stated he had no idea and mentioned he was missing 50% of the equation to have a wife,&nbsp;implying he had no girlfriend.&nbsp;</span></p><p>When the interviewer expressed her disbelief at him not having a partner, <span>Paevey </span>explained he was a workaholic, suggesting he had no time to date.&nbsp;</p><p>You know. I am a workaholic. I don’t even have a dog. I have a thriving houseplant.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Probably, because of his hectic schedule and strict work ethic, <span>Paevey </span>hasn’t been romantically linked with many people. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>He Was Thought To Be Dating Kirsten Storms</h2><p>During <span>Paevey's&nbsp;</span>decade-long presence in the show&nbsp;General Hospital, he was romantically linked to fellow actress Kirsten Storms. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The rumor mill started churning after&nbsp;Storms was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">seen</a>&nbsp;wearing a necklace he handmade for her. However, the duo never commented on the topic.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>A similar rumor surfaced in late 2014 when he interacted with lifestyle blogger and model Jessa Hinton on Twitter. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The rumors <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">emerged</a>&nbsp;after Hinton tweeted her childhood picture and referred to Paevey as her muffin in December 2014. She wrote, "There you go muffin&nbsp;@RyanPaevey." Paevey fueled the gossip,&nbsp;replying with a kiss emoji.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Then in January&nbsp;2015, the pair did a photoshoot for designer Michael Costello. Hinton took to Twitter to post pictures of the event and stated it was one of her favorite shoots. She also thanked the&nbsp;Harvest&nbsp;Love actor for his genuine smiles.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The constant mentions of each other on Twitter made everyone believe the pair were dating. One Twitter user even complimented&nbsp;<span>Paevey, saying he and Hinton made a stunning couple. Interestingly, he didn't object to the praise and instead thanked the commenter.&nbsp;</span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>But by the mid of 2015, the pair had stopped mentioning each other.&nbsp;Since then, the Unleashing Mr. Darcy star hasn’t been romantically linked with anyone, and he prefers to keep his personal life off social media.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The last time he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">talked</a>&nbsp;about his love life was in December 2016. He Instagrammed a picture of his Harley-Davidson and said that the bike was his girlfriend, funnily suggesting that he was single at the moment.&nbsp;</p><h2>General Hospital Kickstarted His Career</h2><p><span>Paevey got his breakthrough from the role of Nathan West in General Hospital. During his five years tenure in the show&nbsp;from 2013 to 2018, he appeared in 283 episodes.</span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p><span>It would be fair to say that the series catapulted him to success.&nbsp;Since then, he has found success in the romantic genre through his portrayal in several <a href=# rel=follow>Hallmark movies</a>.</span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Paevey <span>debuted in Hallmark with the role of Donovan Darcy in Unleashing Mr. Darcy, a modern take on Pride & Prejudice. The 36-year-old&nbsp;has <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">played</a> in multiple Hallmark movies such as&nbsp;Marrying Mr. Darcy, A Summer Romance,&nbsp;and From Friends to Fiance.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Besides acting, he has dabbled into business. He is the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">founder</a>&nbsp;of an&nbsp;outdoor adventure-inspired company&nbsp;Fortunate Wanderer.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>It started as a shop for people who wanted to purchase a print of the actor’s photography. It has grown into a shop that sells everything from handcrafted rings, pendants, bangles, and towels to body oil and bath bombs. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlnoq6ur3nPmpyvnalitKq%2By5%2Bpop2emXq4tcWeZaGsnaE%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
