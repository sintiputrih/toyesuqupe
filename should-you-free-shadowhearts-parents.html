Of course, allowing Shadowheart to execute her parents will result in their death, but it’s much more than that. <b>Killing Shadowheart’s parents will send them to eternal torment in the dark afterlife with Shar, forever separated from their goddess of worship.</b></p><h2>What happens if you free Shadowheart parents?</h2><p>You’re told that, if Shadowheart frees her parents, she’ll continue to suffer from her curse. Alternatively, Shadowheart can let her parents die so she can be free of Shar’s hold on her.</p><h2>What is the best decision for Shadowheart?</h2><p>Shadowheart Approval List</p><ul><li>Kindness towards children.</li><li>Kindness towards animals.</li><li>Avoiding unnecessary violence where possible with persuasion or manipulation.</li><li>Showing distrust towards the Gith.</li><li>Fighting against oppression.</li><li>Allowing her to be faithful to Shar where possible.</li></ul><h2>What happens if you let Shadowheart choose?</h2><p>If you let Shadowheart kill the Nightsong, she will go full Dark Justiciar of Shar mode. Be prepared for her to be dark, brooding, and rather evil for the rest of the game.</p><h2>Can you make Shadowheart evil?</h2><p>Whether Shadowheart is good or evil or chooses to follow Selune or Shar in the end will be determined by the player and the choices made across the game.</p><h2>Shadowheart Parents: All Choices, Outcomes, & Its Effect on Ending | Baldur’s Gate 3 (BG3)</h2><h2>Can you save Shadowheart’s parents?</h2><p>You can choose to save Shadowheart’s parents in either path (Shar or Selune). Both paths will lead to the same outcome with this choice: Shadowheart’s parents will be freed and brought to camp to join you for the remainder of the game.</p><h2>What is the bad ending of Shadowheart?</h2><p>If Shadowheart kills Karlach at the decisive moment, she will become Absolute. Obviously, this ending is regarded as a bad one.</p><h2>Should I trust Shadowheart?</h2><p>Shadowheart will be determined to kill the Nightsong and become a devoted servant of Lady Shar, so the easiest option is to let her. There’s no fight and Shadowheart will do it with ease, but there are wide-reaching consequences.</p><h2>Should I keep Shadowheart in my party?</h2><p>I recommend that if you keep her mainly in your active party, but it is not necessary. You can still skill her as cleric to fulfill some other role than your main character. Respeccing any of them makes no difference from what everyone has said. They still go through the story normally.</p><h2>Is Shadowheart’s dad a werewolf?</h2><p>As a girl, Jenevelle Hallowleaf lived with her parents, Arnell Hallowleaf, an elf werewolf, and Emmeline, a human, both devoted followers of Selûne. As a child of Selûnites, Jenevelle underwent a rite of passage involving finding her way home alone from the woods.</p><h2>Is it possible to free Shadowheart?</h2><p>Use your Illithid power to “Will the pod to open,” which will set Shadowheart free. Once Shadowheart is free, she’ll join your party whether you want her or not – at least for now. With the upcoming boss battle, she’ll be a notable asset to you.</p><h2>What happens if Shadowheart kills Nightsong?</h2><p>Essentially, Shadowheart will be sent down a dark and somewhat evil path by embracing Shar completely upon killing Nightsong. There are still ways of romancing her further on, even if she mentions she has no time for the player, but it is under different and more gruesome consequences.</p><h2>How do I turn Shadowheart into Selune?</h2><p>Save Nightsong – This turns the Spear of Night into Selune’s Spear of Evening and Shadowheart converts to worshipping Selune, leaving her available to romance and changing her appearance.</p><h2>Can I romance Shadowheart if she kills Nightsong?</h2><p>You can convince her to leave a little room for you, which will get you a minimised relationship, but you can’t fully romance Shadowheart unless you save the Nightsong. Doing this will cause her to become a Cleric of Selune, freeing her heart to find true love with your character.</p><h2>Can you do house of grief without Shadowheart?</h2><p>Investigate the House of Grief is a side quest in Baldur’s Gate 3 where you delve into the mystery behind an old man’s missing memories. This quest serves to introduce you to the House of Grief if Shadowheart is absent or her companion quest isn’t a priority, so our walkthrough will ensure you don’t miss out.</p><h2>Who can you sleep with in BG3?</h2><p>Here are all the characters you can form a romantic attachment with in Baldur’s Gate 3.</p><ul><li>Shadowheart.</li><li>Astarion.</li><li>Wyll.</li><li>Lae’zel.</li><li>Gale.</li><li>Karlach.</li><li>Halsin.</li><li>Minthara.</li></ul><h2>What happens if you refuse to party with Shadowheart?</h2><p>Despite all of this, some players are curious to find out what happens to Shadowheart if they refuse to join up with her at any point in the story. Unfortunately, things don’t go well for her, and the player is eventually forced to kill her by the end of it.</p><h2>What happens if Shadowheart doesn’t join your party?</h2><p>However, from here, if you decide to not join forces with Shadowheart, she will wait in this position until you change your mind. And then, even after all of this, if you decide to take the artefact by force, Shadowheart will become hostile and you will be forced to kill her.</p><h2>Why do Shadowheart and Lae Zel hate each other?</h2><p>Both had to fight and kill their peers in order to win any amount of conditional love and praise. In short, both are survivors of abuse and have been molded by abusive relationships. And when they’re around each other, what they hate most about themselves is reflected in the other.</p><h2>Should I let Astarion drink my blood?</h2><p>If you plan to make Astarion a permanent part of your party, you should consider letting him suck your blood for the Happy buff. This buff will add a +1 to all his checks. He will also permanently gain the Vampire Bite action in battle.</p><h2>Should you let Astarion bite you?</h2><p>Accepting Astarion’s bite improves the protagonist’s relationship with him and can lead to a deeper bond, but refusing it only results in a minor setback. While there is a risk of death associated with Astarion’s bite, it does not turn characters into vampires and has only minor physical effects.</p><h2>Can Shadowheart abandon Shar?</h2><p>As much as I try to avoid spoilers, including titles of YouTube videos about BG3, I discovered that it’s possible to make Shadowheart abandon the goddess Shar in act 2 (a good spoiler, actually, I didn’t want her to follow that path).</p><h2>Why does Shadowheart’s hair go white?</h2><p>Once Shadowheart comes to terms with her big decision at the end of Act 2, she will learn more about her past and eventually embrace Selûne as the goddess worthy of her devotion. To reflect her newly recovered faith, Shadowheart will then change her hair color from black to silver and get rid of her bangs.</p><h2>How do you make Shadowheart good?</h2><p>Increase Shadowheart’s Wisdom and Constitution by one point each, to 16 and 18, respectively. This will push both stats up to the next breakpoint, giving her a higher bonus to rolls. You’ll also get a new cantrip of your choosing.</p><h2>Where is Shadowheart if you save her?</h2><p>Once the ship has crashed and you awaken on the beach, you’ll find Shadowheart unconscious just in front of you if you saved her. From there you can ask her to join your party, and she will.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FErJpnm5%2BifKitzKKloGWWlr5wv8eorKWcXa68tnnFq5yeZaOdrqW71qGcmqqkqHqxrdGepa2rXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
