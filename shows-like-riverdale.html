If you love ‘Riverdale’ and looking for more of such stuff, this article is directed at you.</p><p>Before you read on, please remember that every TV series is unique, and has pros and cons of its own. So if you’re looking for a like-for-like substitution for “Riverdale’, that’s barely possible. But still, here’s the list of TV shows similar to Riverdale that are our recommendations. You can stream some of these shows on Netflix or Amazon Prime.</p><h4 style=text-align:center>10. Veronica Mars (2004 – 2007)</h4><p><img decoding=async data-attachment-id=89573 data-permalink=https://thecinemaholic.com/shows-like-riverdale/veronica-mars/ data-orig-file=https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Veronica-mars.jpg data-orig-size=1000,563 data-comments-opened=1 data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"\u00a9 2013 Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.

Kristen Bell is that person plays the pivotal role as the private investigator and has done her role well. Together with the beautiful plot on how the investigation goes, nail-biting occasions on who might have done the crime, occasionally unpredictable scenes and yet touching human lives made the series a good watch.</p><h4 style=text-align:center>9. Twin Peaks (1990 -1991)</h4><p><img decoding=async data-attachment-id=89575 data-permalink=https://thecinemaholic.com/shows-like-riverdale/twin-peaks-5/ data-orig-file=https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/twin-peaks.jpg data-orig-size=1000,563 data-comments-opened=1 data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title="twin peaks" data-image-description data-image-caption data-medium-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/twin-peaks.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/twin-peaks.jpg?w=1000" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/_d_improd_/twin-peaks_f_improf_770x434.jpg alt width=770 height=434 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>‘Twin Peaks’ won’t be for everyone. It’s like David Lynch decided to throw everything from American culture he could get his hands on, toss it in a blender and film the results. One minute it’s like watching a southern soap opera and the next it’s like being thrown into a surreal nightmare that leaves you breathless and bewildered. But if you’re captivated by ‘Twin Peaks’ it will stay with you forever. It is totally unique even to this day and nothing out there is remotely like it.</p><h4 style=text-align:center>8. Gossip Girl (2007 – 2012)</h4><p><img decoding=async data-attachment-id=89581 data-permalink=https://thecinemaholic.com/shows-like-riverdale/gossip-girl-6/ data-orig-file=https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/gossip-girl.jpeg data-orig-size=939,600 data-comments-opened=1 data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title="gossip girl" data-image-description data-image-caption data-medium-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/gossip-girl.jpeg?w=300" data-large-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/gossip-girl.jpeg?w=939" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/gossip-girl-1024x654.jpeg alt width=770 height=492 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Yes, there are many shows that are very similar to this one and you may say “this has been done in the past,” but the point that is trying to be made is that no one is listening. The elements portrayed in this show have been done in many shows and movies before its time. Its the concepts of sex, love, drugs, drinking, suicide, and depression.&nbsp;&nbsp;These things are real problems that are not getting handled in the correct way or at all.&nbsp;I will agree that the show is not like the books, but what movie or show actually follows book line exactly. There is either not enough of a book or there is too much.</p><h4 style=text-align:center>7. Dawson’s Creek (1988 – 2003)</h4><p><img decoding=async data-attachment-id=89584 data-permalink=https://thecinemaholic.com/shows-like-riverdale/dawsons-creek-3/ data-orig-file=https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/dawsons-creek.jpg data-orig-size=1024,576 data-comments-opened=1 data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title="dawson’s creek" data-image-description data-image-caption data-medium-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/dawsons-creek.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/dawsons-creek.jpg?w=1024" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/dawsons-creek-1024x576.jpg alt width=770 height=433 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>‘Dawson’s Creek’ is surprisingly good for what it is, a drama for teenage viewers.&nbsp;The actors are all pretty good for their age. This is the show that made Katie Holmes a star although the other actors in it have not done much since, other than Michelle Williams who comes into the show later on.&nbsp;Good adults in the cast as well. The early seasons of the show are great but it goes a bit down the tubes in later years. Then again, how many shows don’t?</p><h4 style=text-align:center>6. The Killing (2011 – 2014)</h4><p><img decoding=async data-attachment-id=89588 data-permalink=https://thecinemaholic.com/shows-like-riverdale/the-killing/ data-orig-file=https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/the-killing.jpg data-orig-size=980,600 data-comments-opened=1 data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title="the killing" data-image-description data-image-caption data-medium-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/the-killing.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/the-killing.jpg?w=980" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/the-killing-1024x627.jpg alt width=770 height=471 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>‘The Killing’ a solid crime drama with good atmosphere, good cast and it’s moving forward in an ok tempo. And the series also want you to see more. It has a good drive and momentum. A lot of series have a tendency to die out after a while like I said before. But&nbsp; ‘The Killing’ even got more interesting towards the end. Probably, that’s how it is intended to be.&nbsp;The plots are quite gripping and it’s definitely well made.</p><h4 style=text-align:center>5. The Vampire Diaries (2009 – 2017)</h4><p><img decoding=async data-attachment-id=89591 data-permalink=https://thecinemaholic.com/shows-like-riverdale/vampire-diaries-season/ data-orig-file=https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/vampire-diaries-season.jpg data-orig-size=960,600 data-comments-opened=1 data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title=vampire-diaries-season data-image-description data-image-caption data-medium-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/vampire-diaries-season.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/vampire-diaries-season.jpg?w=960" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/vampire-diaries-season-1024x640.jpg alt width=770 height=481 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>The plot of ‘The Vampire Diaries’ with a plot quite similar to The Twilight Saga. It involves the story of a teenage girl stuck and caught in love between two vampire brothers. In spite of its weak script and loose plot holes, you will still like to watch the series for Nina Dobrev and Ian Somerhalder. Ian as the role of Damon, the evil turned good vampire and lover, delivers a passionate feeling, which is enough to sweep girls off feet.</p><h4 style=text-align:center>4. Gilmore Girls (2000 – 2007)</h4><p><img decoding=async data-attachment-id=89593 data-permalink=https://thecinemaholic.com/shows-like-riverdale/gilmore-girls/ data-orig-file=https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/gilmore-girls.jpg data-orig-size=1071,600 data-comments-opened=1 data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title="gilmore girls" data-image-description data-image-caption data-medium-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/gilmore-girls.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/gilmore-girls.jpg?w=1024" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/gilmore-girls-1024x574.jpg alt width=770 height=432 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>What gives this show its watchable factor is the good supporting cast and the well-written lines they deliver. The town of Stars Hollow is a clever little town that always has something going on. Sadly the last season and a half wandered around in circles with the main characters doing things that mad no sense. Rumors were writers wanted a season 8 but main actors Graham and Bledel did not want to.&nbsp;That being said, ‘Gilmore Girls’ is a great show well worth watching.</p><h4 style=text-align:center>3. 13 Reasons Why (2017-)</h4><p><img decoding=async data-attachment-id=77539 data-permalink=https://thecinemaholic.com/tv-shows-like-gossip-girl/13-reasons-why/ data-orig-file=https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/13-reasons-why.jpg data-orig-size=900,600 data-comments-opened=1 data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title=13-reasons-why data-image-description data-image-caption data-medium-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/13-reasons-why.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/13-reasons-why.jpg?w=900" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/13-reasons-why-1024x683.jpg alt width=770 height=514 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>’13 Reasons Why’ is profound, moving, disturbing and massively important. Brilliant and devastating in equal measures. Caution, this is most definitely tough to watch, but do it. It is well written and acted.&nbsp; There is a lot of negative criticism regarding the second season and sometimes. Many argue that the series should’ve ended as a “Hannah Baker story”. But I think there’s more to it. ’13 Reasons Why’ is a refreshing and unflinching look at taboo subjects that are rarely touched upon in mainstream media, for me at least. It would’ve been perfect if it wasn’t for the cliffhanger ending of season 2.</p><h4 style=text-align:center>2. Stranger Things (2016 – To Date)</h4><p><img decoding=async data-attachment-id=78268 data-permalink=https://thecinemaholic.com/stranger-things-ending-explained/stranger-things-3/ data-orig-file=https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Stranger-Things-3.jpg data-orig-size=1024,576 data-comments-opened=1 data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title="Stranger Things 3" data-image-description data-image-caption data-medium-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Stranger-Things-3.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Stranger-Things-3.jpg?w=1024" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Stranger-Things-3-1024x576.jpg alt width=770 height=433 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>‘Stranger Things’ is definitely one of the best shows on TV right now. It has everything. It’s beautifully made, it’s scary but also emotional, it’s full of horror but also speaks to your heart. If you haven’t already, and whether you love ‘Riverdale’ or not, go watch it, you won’t regret. The Duffer Brothers have done an amazing job. Similar to ‘Riverdale’, this show is set in a world of its own and is based on a book. The difference is the age group of the lead cast.</p><h4 style=text-align:center>1. Pretty Little Liars (2010 -2017)</h4><p><img decoding=async data-attachment-id=89596 data-permalink=https://thecinemaholic.com/shows-like-riverdale/pretty-little-liars-2/ data-orig-file=https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pretty-little-liars.jpg data-orig-size=800,450 data-comments-opened=1 data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title="pretty little liars" data-image-description data-image-caption data-medium-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pretty-little-liars.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pretty-little-liars.jpg?w=800" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/_d_improd_/pretty-little-liars_f_improf_770x433.jpg alt width=770 height=433 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Even a good show can get tired of itself. However, ‘Pretty Little Liars’ always finds ways to be fresh and original. Whether it be the twists and turns or the creepy episodes in the 4th season, this show always knows how to stay original.&nbsp;It is aa one heartfelt exploration of love, loss, friendship, sexuality, parenting, divorce, extra-marital affairs, family, and hope.&nbsp;Also just to mention, it is not your very real to life story. The series is set in its own world, similar to ‘Riverdale’</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwqrrEppihp5yesG%2BvzqZmrKCfrMBuuMiknGaqmauys7DApZxo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
