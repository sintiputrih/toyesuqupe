As long as it didn’t smell totally rancid, it was good enough for Us. Now that it’s taken on a whole new importance, however, we’re thoroughly reading ingredient labels and reviews before even thinking about a purchase!</p><p>Most importantly, we need a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol content to fit the CDC’s guidelines for killing virus-causing germs and bacteria. With alcohol, however, comes dry, red, irritated skin. That’s why second on our list is finding a beloved alcohol-based sanitizer with skin-conditioning ingredients to protect our hands not only from contagions, but from painful, cracking skin. And if that sanitizer happens to come in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">a pack of four that ships out super fast</a>? Well, even better!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Skindom Hand Sanitizer Clean Gel (4-Pack)</a> for just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">$20</a> at Amazon!

Multiple shoppers say it’s the best sanitizer they’ve ever used and that they definitely plan on repurchasing it. They love that it comes in a four-pack too — designating one for home, one for work, one for their car and one for traveling. Now they just need a huge bottle to use at home too. They say they love having this as a second line of defense and that it even smells amazing! This sanitizer seriously does it all.</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Skindom Hand Sanitizer Clean Gel (4-Pack)</a> for just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">$20</a> at Amazon!
