She has collaborated on numerous projects with Mamamoo and has also worked in television, appearing in several variety shows and serving as a show host.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Sol1.jpg><h2>Solar Childhood/Education</h2><p>Regarding her education, Solar was raised in Seoul by her parents, along with an older sister. She aspired to a career in the music industry at a young age because she enjoyed singing. She honed her skills over time, and while pursuing her education, she auditioned for RBW, or Rainbow Bridge World – the entertainment company responsible for the creation of acts like Vromance and ONEUS. The audition went well, and she began training with the company while also finishing her studies at Hanyang Women’s University.</p><h2>Solar Pursue Career, Professional Life</h2><p>She was set to join a new girl group called Mamamoo, which was formed by Moonbyul, Hwasa, and Wheein. Prior to their official debut, the group gained notoriety through collaborative work with artists such as Bumkey, K.Will, and the rap duo Geeks. They made their official debut in mid-2014 with the release of the single “Mr. Ambiguous,” which served as the lead single for their first extended play (EP) titled “Hello”; the music video for the single featured cameos from various K-pop artists. The new group then made their first appearance on a music show, “M Countdown.”</p><p>Later that year, Mamamoo released its second EP, “Piano Man,” which included the lead single of the same name. They were having a lot of commercial success, and the following year they worked on their third EP, “Pink Funky.” They also released the lead single, “Um Oh Ah Yeh,” a commercial success, charting at number three on the Gaon Chart. Their popularity was confirmed when they were chosen to perform at an event sponsored by the South Korean embassy in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.</p><h2>More On Career</h2><p>The group’s first concert since its debut was held in 2016 at the Olympic Hall in Seoul, and tickets were quickly sold out. They then began work on their first studio album, “Melting,” which debuted in third place on the Gaon chart. They then won their first music show with “Inkigayo,” receiving a total of eight votes for that song. Later that year, they released another EP titled “Memory” and then went on to perform their second solo shows in Seoul and Busan.</p><p>Around this time, they sparked a lot of controversy by performing in blackface make-up, which was meant to be a tribute to Bruno Mars but backfired, resulting in a lot of apologies from the label and the members.</p><p>Later that year, Mamamoo released their fifth EP, “Purple,” which included the title track “Yes I Am,” which quickly rose to the top of the Melon charts and set a record for the unique listeners in a single day; the single also won multiple music shows.</p><p>In 2018, they began releasing singles to promote their upcoming project, “Four Seasons 4 Colors” – it began with their sixth EP, “Yellow Flower,” which featured the charting single “Starry Night.”</p><p>After their third solo show, they released the second of the 4 Seasons project, “Red Moon,” which featured the lead single “Egotistic” and peaked at number four on the Billboard World Albums chart. In Japan, they signed with Victor Entertainment, which resulted in their first Japanese single, “Decalomanie.”</p><p>The third installment of the 4 Seasons projects, “Blues,” with the title track “Wind Flower,” was released. They finished the 4 Seasons Project in 2019 with the EP “White Wind” and then went on their fourth tour before releasing their second studio album “Reality in Black” later that year.</p><h2>Solar Dating Relationship And Affairs</h2><p>Solar is single and, like many K-pop artists, does not discuss her romantic relationships.</p><p>They prefer to keep their private lives hidden from the public eye because the entertainment industry is very strict about revealing information about partners.</p><p>She would have been a flight attendant if she hadn’t become a K-pop idol. She still enjoys touring and tourism and has expressed a desire to work as a tour guide for foreign visitors in Korea. Irene from Red Velvet is a close friend of hers. Because of her fear of (imaginary?) ghosts, she is often called a scaredy-cat.</p><h2>Facts</h2><li>She is the leader of MAMAMOO.</li><li>She likes listening to Lil Wayne.</li><li>Solar can play the piano.</li><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Singer</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiqqKSRp3w%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
