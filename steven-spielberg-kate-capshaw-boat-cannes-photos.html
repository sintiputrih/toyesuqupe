Following cancellation due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the festivities kicked off in Cannes, France on Tuesday, July 6 and will run until Saturday, July 17. <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Spike Lee</strong></a> has been appointed head of jury for this year’s festival.

When his first son Max was born, Steven revealed that his &nbsp;“paradigm changed, and everything from that moment on had to do with my kids’ wellbeing, and my career suddenly became second,” the director said. Now that his children are adults, the director tries to be more mindful. If his children were to say that he spent too much time at work, “I will always drop everything&nbsp;and go meet those needs. That’s the priority.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>“They always need mom and dad, and I am either there with my kids or my wife is, but they’re never without us,” Steven said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH14e49wZqyslauyr3nSqaCepJKav6h5ypqrnmWTlr20tMCwZJunkal6pK3Np5ysZaCdvLW70mg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
