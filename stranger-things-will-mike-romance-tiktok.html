LGBTQIA+ members of the fandom made fan-cams on TikTok alluding to Will having a big old crush on his straight bestie Mike Wheeler (Finn Wolfhard), which if true, would really just scream gay rights. It’s gay culture to have a fat crush on your best friend at school.</p><p data-characters=173 data-current-count=567 data-injectable=true>One fan-cam referenced an interview with Schnapp’s co-stars David Harbour, Winona Ryder, and Wolfhard where Harbour hinted at Will’s newly discovered sexuality.</p><p data-characters=125 data-current-count=125 data-injectable=false>“Will is not interested in El [Millie Bobby Brown].

Are you upset?’ And she was like, ‘no, no, we’re not talking about that right now. There’s still seven more hours.
