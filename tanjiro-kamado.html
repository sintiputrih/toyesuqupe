main protagonist of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba. In the Demon Slayer Corps, he is a Demon Slayer who joined in order to cure his sister Nezuko Kamado, aka “The Whistler,” and to destroy demons and later vowed to defeat Muzan Kibutsuji, King of Demons, in order to prevent others from suffering the same fate. Before he became a Demon Slayer, Tanjiro was a coal burner before his entire family was slaughtered by Muzan while his younger sister, Nezuko, was turned into a demon.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tanjiro Kamado Height & Weight</h2><p>Tanjiro is a young boy who stands around 5’5″. He has fair skin and an athletic, muscular build. His hair is ruffled with burgundy ends and brushed back to expose his forehead, and his eyes are wide and dark crimson in color with white pupils that appear lighter lower on the irises.</p><p>He also has a scar on top of his forehead, first seen when his mother carried him to watch his father perform the Hinokami Kagura dance. As a result of his rigorous training under Sakonji Urokodaki, Tanjiro’s scar initially appeared to be a grazing wound before his fight with the Hand Demon during the Final Selection, after which it develops into a flame-like pattern as his Demon Slayer Mark.</p><p>According to reports, Tanjiro’s hands are rougher than normal for someone of his age, due to his intensive training with Sakonji Urokodaki. Tanjiro has Sumiyoshi’s facial structure, eyes, and hairstyle but with longer hair that is tied in a ponytail behind his head; Sumiyoshi’s hair was shorter, around shoulder length and would be combed over one shoulder.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tanjiro Kamado Appearance</h2><p>Tanjiro’s first appearance is as a checkered, black-and-sea-foam-green haori over a white robe and black pants. He has a turquoise scarf on occasion and sports circular, white bands looped around his calves. He also wears a unique pair of hanafuda earrings with the image of the rising sun over a mountain. His hair is always kept back in a small ponytail or bun; as he trains with Sabito and Makomo, his hair grows to his neck.</p><p>Tanjiro wears a blue, cloud-patterned samue-styled kimono and black pants during the Final Selection, very similar to Sakonji’s. He still sports his hanafuda earrings, but his hair is now extremely short and remains that way for the rest of the film. Tanjiro, like the other apprentices trained by Sakonji, wears a hand-carved fox mask carved from his master on the left side of his head. The eyes, ears, and markings on each corner of the mouth are painted red. A sun-shaped design is embroidered on the upper right corner of the mask, which may allude to Tanjiro’s scar.</p><p>Tanjiro dons the standard Demon Slayer garb, a dark-brown gakuran jacket, a white belt, baggy chocho zubon pants that extend into tabi socks, a pair of zōri with red straps, and bands of white cloth wrapped tightly around his calves that resemble kyahan as he becomes a Demon Slayer. During the day, he carries a huge wooden box on his back where his sister sleeps while they travel.</p><p><strong>Read Also:</strong> <a href=#>What time is Demon Slayer season 2 episode 10 coming out?</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tanjiro Kamado Battle With Muzan Kibutsuji</h2><p>During his second battle with Muzan Kibutsuji, he damages his right eye at the Infinity Castle. Due to Muzan’s poison, Tanjiro collapses suddenly and a significant amount of pus forms over his right eye as the battle progresses. Later on, when Tanjiro regains consciousness, Muzan describes him as looking “hideous.” Tanjiro loses his left arm during their engagement.</p><p>Tanjiro is able to heal the growth on his face and regenerate his lost arm and other minor injuries after being transformed into a demon by Muzan. After he overcame the sunlight weakness, he acquired eyes with slit pupils, fangs, and flame-shaped marks over his left forehead and right jaw that were reminiscent of those of Kokushibo, as well as a third, smaller flame-shaped mark that came down from the right side of his head down to his eyebrow.</p><p>His scar, which is now a flame-pattern like the Demon Slayer Mark, has grown longer and is the largest of the three. All three scars seem to point towards his nose, although only his scar-mark reaches it. He continues to wear his bloodstained military uniform with one sleeve cut off where his arm was sliced off, but he loses his checkered haori and Nichirin Sword at his side.</p><p>When Tanjiro transforms back into his human form, he loses the capacity to see out of his right eye, with the iris being a dull pink-gray color and the pupil black rather than white. His left arm, which he regrew as a Demon, now resembles that of an older person, becoming crepy and bony, and he loses all sensation in it from his elbow down.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tanjiro Kamado MCQs</h2><p><strong>What is Tanjiro’s first appearance?</strong> Wearing a checkered, black-and-sea-foam-green haori over a white robe and black pants.

On his right eye, left arm, and neck. On his left forehead, right jaw, and nose.</p><p><strong>When Tanjiro transforms back into his human form, what does he lose?</strong> The capacity to see out of his right eye and sensation in his left arm from the elbow down.
