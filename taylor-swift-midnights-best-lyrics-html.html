Taylor Swift’s highly anticipated tenth album, Midnights, <a href=#>has finally arrived</a> and encapsulated all of our late-night thoughts. With the release, she has once again confirmed that she’s a night owl, dropping emotional lyrics that have us dusting off our dictionaries and grabbing a glass of wine for the long evening ahead. Swift has always been vulnerable about the relationships in her life, whether they are romantic, platonic, or business, as well as open about being burned by those closest to her. That all gives Swifties motivation to dig deeper into her lyrics, in an attempt to figure out what keeps their favorite singer up at night. In the days leading up to the record, Swift told <a href=#>Spotify </a>the five feelings she had when writing the album: self-loathing, fantasizing about revenge, wondering what might have been, falling in love, and falling apart (<a href=#>she loves to categorize songs</a>). Below, we have organized the album’s best lyrics based on those guiding principles.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl9ip820k001t3b6wyfu7bb3f@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Self-Loathing</span></h2><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl9iu1bjc001q3b77nwe4d3nc@published>“Anti-Hero”</h2><p>Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguised as altruism /Like some kind of congressman</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl9ip9mzn00293b6wh1nyt9m1@published data-word-count=62>The ideal night of swimming in your own sadness and pity definitely includes calling yourself a narcissist and then considering every nice thing you’ve ever done a big evil scheme to make you look like a good person. It’s also the perfect lyric to get you in the mood for the upcoming November elections if you want to think about actual narcissism.</p><p>Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby</p><p>And I’m a monster on the hill</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl9isut3m00f83b76ff3g984z@published data-word-count=40>Sexy baby has to be an inside joke, right? Like, I totally get feeling not as hot or confident as everyone else in the room, but for everyone else to be a sexy baby is giving Jacob from <a href=#>Twilight</a> vibes.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl9iu2eqv00203b77t4e24x2f@published>“Sweet Nothing”</h2><p>Industry disruptors and soul deconstructors</p><p>And smooth-talking hucksters out glad-handing each other</p><p>And the voices that implore, “you should be doing more”</p><p>To you I can admit, that I’m just too soft for all of it</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl9ipadep00423b6wfme11kul@published data-word-count=40>Swift is entering her traveling-salesman era by using the term “huckster”; she’s also leaning into what I assume to be Britishness with her co-writer William Bowery, while forcing every overachiever to flinch at the line “you should be doing more.”</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl9ips6kn004p3b6whrpeq5m4@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Fantasizing about revenge</span></h2><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl9iu35kq002a3b77qbvl4mf9@published>“Vigilante Shit”</h2><p>She needed cold hard proof so I give her some</p><p>She had the envelope, where’d you think she got it from?</p><p>Now she gets the house, gets the kids, gets the pride</p><p>Picture me, thick as thieves with your ex-wife</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl9ipsn0f00653b6wal43pxsy@published data-word-count=55>Swift wasn’t kidding when she said she’d be up late fantasizing about revenge. Also, if you’re losing sleep over it, it has to be juicy. Assuming this song is about her feud with Scooter Braun, she’s taking no prisoners by bringing up his divorce and <a href=#>a $200 million dollar lawsuit</a>. Stop, Taylor, he’s already dead.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl9iu4kdf002k3b77u1kogny8@published>“Bejeweled”</h2><p>Baby love, I think I’ve been a little too kind</p><p>Didn’t notice you walking all over my peace of mind</p><p>In the shoes I gave you as a present</p><p>Puttin’ someone first only works when you’re in their top five</p><p>And by the way, I’m going out tonight</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl9ipulbr00a33b6wpuax0eze@published data-word-count=29>When you’re stuck in a controlling relationship and finally regaining your self-worth, there’s nothing better than telling someone off, even if they’re still wearing the gifts you’ve given them.</p><p>I think it’s time to teach some lessons</p><p>I made you my world (Huh?), have you heard? (Huh?)</p><p>I can reclaim the land</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl9isgihd00803b76xvjr1mpl@published data-word-count=54>As Swift continues to regain her power throughout the song, the invasive middle of the night thoughts creep back in: What if she wants the toxic person back? She’s stronger now, she could take him on. (Though careful, Taylor, with how you phrase it; you don’t want to become a meme like <a href=#>Rosalía did</a>.)</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl9iub95j000r3b77w2qh629r@published>“Karma”</h2><p>’Cause karma is my boyfriend, karma is a god</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl9ipven000dc3b6wge649azv@published data-word-count=61>Sexist jokes have been thrown at Swift throughout her career, specifically those who called her a serial dater during her late teens and early 20s (honestly, who wasn’t at that age?). She pokes fun at those criticisms by calling karma “her boyfriend,” her longest relationship to date. It doesn’t hurt too that she’s been with William Bowery Joe Alwyn since 2016.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl9ipx5rd00fg3b6w57gt715g@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Wondering what might have been</span></h2><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl9iubk9c00113b77aietx32f@published>“Question…?”</h2><p>Did you leave her house in the middle of the night?&nbsp;</p><p>Did you wish you put up more of a fight?&nbsp;</p><p>When she said it was too much?&nbsp;</p><p>do you wish you could still touch her?</p><p>It’s just a question</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl9ipxggj00g13b6w72q0rk07@published data-word-count=43>This is for every anxious attached person that gets slightly comfortable with their partner. It is our time to rise up and ask them a million questions knowing the answers will be painful no matter what.

Pick a side, people! Swift challenges the antiquated ideas of weddings here, addressing the “<a href=#>weird rumors</a>” surrounding her relationship, even when she’s in the thick of being in love.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl9iuh74s001v3b77ld4p9l8q@published>“Snow on the Beach”</h2><p>But your eyes are flying saucers</p><p>From another planet</p><p>Now I’m all for you like Janet</p><p>Can this be a real thing? Can it?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl9iq1dz800qz3b6whkpyqyse@published data-word-count=62>For someone who isn’t afraid to write songs about those important in her life, Swift shows a new vulnerability by being too afraid of admitting that she’s falling in love. While Lana Del Rey did not get a verse in the song, her presence is definitely there with the “all for you like Janet,” line that celebrates Swift’s love for her muse.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl9iq3ngk014j3b6w16jj3uak@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Falling apart</span></h2><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl9iuibjy002f3b77so8f3pur@published>“You’re On Your Own, Kid”</h2><p>From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes</p><p>I gave my blood, sweat and tears for this</p><p>I hosted parties and starved my body</p><p>Like I’d be saved by a perfect kiss</p><p>The jokes weren’t funny, I took the money</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl9iq35l4012s3b6wutvysbp1@published data-word-count=58>I, too, will never forgive or forget if someone said I wasn’t funny. Similar to “Never Grow Up,” Swift recounts her transition into adulthood and the loneliness that comes with it. She references her eating disorder that she revealed during her Miss Americana Netflix documentary, able to see her destructive behavior with larger clarity as a 32-year-old woman.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl9iuj23b002q3b772z56prwh@published>“Maroon”</h2><p>The burgundy on my t-shirt when you splashed the wine into me</p><p>And how the blood rushed into my cheeks, so scarlet, it was</p><p>The mark they saw on my collarbone, the rust that grew between telephones</p><p>The lips I used to call home, so scarlet, it was maroon</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl9iujs1r00433b77k0qvjt8g@published data-word-count=45>Jake Gyllenhaal may never rest as long as Swift is awake at midnight. Since the track was announced, people were quick to make connections to last year’s Swift release, Red (Taylor’s Version), as she describes the various shades of red, all in a darker hue.</p><h2 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h2><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/ckikeqha60000b6ob49p53bov@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>All of Taylor Swift’s Famously Devastating Track 5’s, Ranked</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cl9ifg7i100007lkjramtrxmo@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Taylor Swift’s Dream About a Killer Daughter-in-Law Comes to Life in ‘Anti-Hero’</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cl9hdoak20000mvilpy5c0pds@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Taylor Swift’s Swear-iest Midnights Lyrics, Ranked</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Taylor Swift’s Most Notable Midnights Lyrics</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlpa2dhZXy1rdilpqtlo6y2p8CMpqCdppmctbW%2FjJucrKxdocaztcKsZaGsnaE%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
