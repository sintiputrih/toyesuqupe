"I fell in love with Joaquin the second I saw him," Tyler told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Morning Call</a> in 1997. They kept their relationship hidden from everyone on the film using a (needlessly) elaborate ruse. “[Joaquin] would sit at the other end of the makeup trailer and say, 'Oh, my God, [Liv’s] such a babe,' and talk to the makeup girl. It would be like, 'I could never get her,' and she believed him,” Tyler explained.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Ron Galella, Ltd./Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Why We Loved Them:</strong> Their brand of young celebrity love was just so pure. “I didn't feel threatened or afraid of the idea to get involved with him when we were working,” <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Tyler said</a> of the relationship. “I just kind of knew and hoped and prayed that I would love him forever.” Phoenix was “moved by” his co-star’s “honesty” and valued her friendship above all. "What I felt about her was that I have a new friend, a really great friend,” he shared.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Time & Life Pictures/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>When They Peaked:</strong> It’s honestly possible that their peak is still forthcoming. Phoenix and Tyler remained friends following their 1998 split, and it wasn't the kind of “friendship” a publicist’s breakup statement promises (you know the kind), but a friendship that includes supporting each other’s ventures and recording videos for charity together (see this incredibly strange <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>To Write Love on Her Arms video</a> from 2010, feat. a pre-Bangerz Miley Cyrus).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2015, Tyler attended a benefit for The Lunchbox Fund, which counts Phoenix and his sister Rain as members of its board of directors. Tyler was totally chill about brushing shoulders with her ex, telling <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Elle</a>, “I consider Joaquin and all of his sisters to be like family. We were so young when we were together, like 18 to 21. He was my first love. So he's a huge part of even my sense of humor. Like, [my son] Milo will say something and I'll say, 'Wow, that's something that Rain said! That's something Joaquin said!' Because they were such a big part of those years when you're just starting out on your own. I have so much love for that family. I learned a lot from them.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Tom Wargacki/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>The Breakup:</strong> Phoenix and Tyler ultimately went their separate ways because they … stopped fighting? During an interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Cosmopolitan</a> in 1999, he said, "I’m a great believer in people coming into your life, and you into theirs, for a reason. And I know that when Liv and I met, it was for a reason — I really needed her and she really needed me. And at a certain point, I think we stopped evolving with each other, stopped progressing, and made a very mature decision to move on, even though there was still a great love there. There’s no one gossipy thing that I can share. I’m thankful that we had the time we had." Nice, but also, "When you become satisfied, you stop fighting, and I like fighting. It means that I’m constantly progressing and evolving. I`m never satisfied, and hopefully, I never will be."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Randy Shropshire/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Testament to how smooth the split was, nearly 15 years later Phoenix told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Guardian</a> he'd never "felt heartbroken" following a relationship. "The closest I've got is getting my ego bruised a little bit. But I've never had the experience of, 'That was somebody I really loved and I'm not done," he explained.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Where They Are Now:</strong> Phoenix is reportedly engaged to actress Rooney Mara, whom he starred alongside in 2018 film Mary Magdalene.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the years since his split with Tyler, Phoenix has risen to become one of Hollywood’s most sought-after (and unpredictable) actors. Most recently, he’s earned critical acclaim for origin film Joker.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: Liv Tyler Dons Bangs for Ad Astra Premiere</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Tyler is engaged to sports agent Dave Gardner, with whom she shares two children (Sailor, 4, and Lula, 3). She also shares a 14-year-old son, Milo, with ex-husband Royston Langdon.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The actress can most recently be seen in Ad Astra and Hulu series Harlots. Last month it was announced that she’ll lead Austin-based 9-1-1 spin-off series 9-1-1: Lone Star opposite Rob Lowe.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGekl8Futs6aqK6hnmK9qbvEp6CxZZyew27A2KWcq2WimrmiwMiopaygmaU%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
