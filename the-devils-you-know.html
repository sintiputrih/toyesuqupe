Proceed to your meeting (Subsection Seven)</h3><p>Return to the building and use the elevator to get to the previously inaccessible "Subsection Seven" level. Go forward until you reach a room where a man is sitting behind a glass wall.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/49/screenshots/2023/09/640/proceed-to-your-meeting-subsection-seven.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt="Proceed to your meeting (Subsection Seven)" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><h3 class=he-c>2. Use the intercom</h3><p>There's someone living down here... and he's asked to speak to me.</p><p>Use the intercom located on the table to start a conversation.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/49/screenshots/2023/09/640/use-the-intercom.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt="Use the intercom" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><h3 class=he-c>3. Speak to the stranger / Speak to Vae Victis</h3><p>After conversing for a while, you will learn that the person you are talking to is Fran√ßois Sanon, known as Vae Victis. He has valuable information that may be useful to you but in return he wants you to do something for him.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/49/screenshots/2023/09/640/speak-to-vae-victis.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt="Speak to the stranger / Speak to Vae Victis" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><h3 class=he-c>4. Speak to Captain Marquez / (Optional) Speak to Deputy MacIntyre</h3><p>I just spoke to Vae Victis, a former UC admiral and a man who's supposed to be dead. He asked me to track down - and "deal with" - a rogue weapons scientist named Reginald Orlase. He believes Orlase is hiding near the planet of Etherea in the Wolf system, and that I should speak to the local head of the Vanguard - Captain Marquez - to get specifics.</p><p>Before you continue on your way, you can talk to MacIntyre and tell her what you learned and what Vae Victis asked you to do. You will receive her full approval and a request for discretion.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/49/screenshots/2023/09/640/speak-to-deputy-macintyre-2.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt="Speak to Captain Marquez / (Optional) Speak to Deputy MacIntyre" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><p>Then return to your ship, travel to the Wolf system and dock at The Den space station.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/49/screenshots/2023/09/640/speak-to-captain-marquez-1.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt="Speak to Captain Marquez / (Optional) Speak to Deputy MacIntyre" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/49/screenshots/2023/09/640/speak-to-captain-marquez-2.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt="Speak to Captain Marquez / (Optional) Speak to Deputy MacIntyre" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><p>Captain Marquez is aboard the space station.

Find "The Warlock"</h3><p>Captain Marquez has given me the coordinates I need to find "The Warlock," a ship that may be home to Orlase. But she warned me to be careful - a number of ships have been lost in the debris fields where the Warlock's been seen.</p><p>Return to your ship and proceed to the Etherea Ruins.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/49/screenshots/2023/09/640/find-the-warlock-1.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt='Find "The Warlock"' style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><p>After a while you should be attacked by an enemy ship.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/49/screenshots/2023/09/640/find-the-warlock-2.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt='Find "The Warlock"' style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><h3 class=he-c>6. Destroy the ship / Collect the evidence</h3><p>I've found the Warlock. And whoever's piloting it doesn't sound pleased I'm here. Time to either disable his engines to capture him (using an EM Weapon or the Targeting Control Systems skill)... or shoot him out of the sky.</p><p>You can simply destroy the enemy ship and then take the <strong>UC Science Division ID: Orlase, Reginald</strong> from its remains as proof that you did it.</p><p>I destroyed the Warlock - and its pilot with it. I need to search the wreckage, find evidence this was Orlase.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/49/screenshots/2023/09/640/collect-the-evidence-1.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt="Destroy the ship / Collect the evidence" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><h3 class=he-c>7. OR Disable the engines / Board "The Warlock" / Arrest the pilot / Collect the evidence</h3><p>You can also disable the engines of an enemy ship, which will enable you to board it.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/49/screenshots/2023/09/640/disable-the-engines.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt='OR Disable the engines / Board "The Warlock" / Arrest the pilot / Collect the evidence' style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><p>I've disabled the Warlock's engines. Now I should be able to board his ship and see if I can't capture its pilot!</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/49/screenshots/2023/09/640/board-the-warlock.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt='OR Disable the engines / Board "The Warlock" / Arrest the pilot / Collect the evidence' style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><p>I'm onboard the Warlock! Time to confront the pilot!</p><p>Orlase has locked himself in the cockpit and you won't be able to arrest him because he will choose to kill himself rather than get arrested.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/49/screenshots/2023/09/640/arrest-the-pilot.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt='OR Disable the engines / Board "The Warlock" / Arrest the pilot / Collect the evidence' style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><p>Orlase killed himself rather than be captured. I guess I should check him for evidence I could show to Vae Victis.</p><p>Just wait a while for the emergency opening of the cockpit after the pilot's death and take the evidence from his corpse.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/49/screenshots/2023/09/640/collect-the-evidence-2.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt='OR Disable the engines / Board "The Warlock" / Arrest the pilot / Collect the evidence' style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><h3 class=he-c>8. Return the evidence to Vae Victis</h3><p>I found Orlase's old United Colonies ID. This should be sufficient evidence to prove to Vae Victis the job is done.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/49/screenshots/2023/09/640/return-the-evidence-to-vae-victis.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt="Return the evidence to Vae Victis" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><h3 class=he-c>9. Transfer the ID to Vae Victis</h3><p>Vae Victis has asked me to hand over the evidence I collected that Orlase is dead. I should approach the transfer system.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/49/screenshots/2023/09/640/transfer-the-id-to-vae-victis.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt="Transfer the ID to Vae Victis" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><h3 class=he-c>10. Speak to Vae Victis</h3><p>I've handed over the ID. Time to get the location of Hadrian and Percival's research team.</p><p>Once again speak with Vae Victis. He will give you the information you need after which this mission will end and another one will begin - "<a href=#>War Relics</a>". You will receive 150 XP and 3,000 credits.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/49/screenshots/2023/09/640/speak-to-vae-victis-2.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt="Speak to Vae Victis" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><p>Vae Victis is going to arrange to have the research team arrive at the Red Devils HQ. All but one - Kaiser - who I'll need to recover from Niira. Vae Victis suggested I check in with Hadrian first, as she'll likely have more information about this missing teammate.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifpZ6xpr%2BToJimnaKoe6S7zGiqrZmim7amuMNoqK6do6l8tbTEZpuerpmhwG7Fzq5kpKafrHw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
