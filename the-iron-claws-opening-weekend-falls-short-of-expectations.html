The film has already released but it didn’t exactly set the fire on fire at the Box Office.</p><p><a href=#>The first trailer for the film was released&nbsp;</a>earlier this year and it showed Zac Efron looking absolutely jacked as he was running the ropes, among other things. Naturally, the film is expected to be an emotional roller coaster in a big way.</p><p>This film released in theaters on Friday, December 22, with future streaming&nbsp;<a href=#>availability on MAX</a>. Reviews for the film have been overwhelmingly positive thanks to the cast’s incredible performances.</p><p>However, according to <a href=#>Dave Meltzer on FW Daily Update</a>, The Iron Claw has not managed to do all that well at the Box Office this weekend, as it is estimated to earn $5.06 million in 2,774 theaters in week one.</p><p>”The Iron Claw was No. 6 at the box office for the weekend and will do an estimated $5.06 million in 2,774 theaters in week one. I don’t think anyone expected this to do big numbers at the theaters. I saw it at a theater Friday night in Santa Barbara and aside from a large family, we were the only ones in the theater and there were no wrestling fans there.”</p><p>The film also had the cast do authentic, <a href=#>full-length wrestling moves in order to give legitimacy to the scenes in the ring</a>. Regardless, what’s done is done and pro wrestling fans who cared enough will go to watch.</p><p>What’s your view on this story about ‘The Iron Claw?’ Are you disappointed by these Box Office numbers?
