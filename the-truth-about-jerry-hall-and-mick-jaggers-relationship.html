While she had decided to overlook Mick Jagger's alleged affairs for years, there were some things she simply couldn't get over, such as his absence.&nbsp;As she wrote in "Jerry Hall: My Life in Pictures" (via <a href=#>Daily Mail</a>), "I was heartbroken that he wasn't home in time for the birth of our fourth child."&nbsp;However, she knew she had to go when rumors began swirling that Jagger had an affair with model Luciana Gimenez Morad during The Rolling Stones' tour and that she was pregnant. Hall wrote, "It was the final straw. I told him I wanted a divorce." As she explained, "I had been tempted to leave him many times but had put up with his infidelities, however, having a child with another woman was too much."</p><p dir=ltr>Speaking with <a href=#>Express</a> in 2017, Hall noted how she their relationship left her feeling backed into a corner. "I forgave and forgave and forgave to the point that it wasn't healthy at all," she shared. "I did love Mick very much, but after years and years of being hopeful, you finally give up."</p><p dir=ltr>In May 1999, Morad gave birth to a son, per <a href=#>New York Post</a>, and a DNA test proved that Jagger was indeed the father. Morad later revealed to the <a href=#>Daily Mail</a> she had written a letter to Hall to apologize, but maintained, "I never saw myself as a home-wrecker."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcmpoan1ye9OhnGasoqrBqXnAm6aurF2fsrO%2B2GafmqScYq6vsIymoJyjXZ%2BuqLPEq6pmqpWhrrW1zqeqoaGgZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
