Usually dressed in a red jacket, black shirt, and slacks, he’s cycled through cosmetic bruises, bandages, and otherwise bloodied appearances while adhering to a dark, retro vibe. Though the singer has typically left these displays up to our own interpretations, he recently offered a (brief) explanation of his latest visual approach, ahead of his headlining performance at Sunday’s Super Bowl Halftime Show.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“The significance of the entire head bandages is reflecting on the absurd culture of Hollywood celebrity and people manipulating themselves for superficial reasons to please and be validated,” he told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://variety.com/2021/music/news/the-weeknd-bandages-super-bowl-plastic-surgery-1234898743/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Variety class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Variety</a> this week.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And while the idea of a night in Vegas gone wrong might’ve partially inspired his look, the concept has progressed. “It’s all a progression and we watch The Character’s storyline hit heightened levels of danger and absurdity as his tale goes on,” he added to the outlet.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Weeknd doesn’t have a problem with appearing bruised and scarred either. “I suppose you could take that being attractive isn’t important to me but a compelling narrative is,” he also said.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And what a narrative it is. The Weeknd's grisly facade seems to trace back to his "Blinding Lights" music video, released at the top of last year.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">He started bringing the bloody look to public appearances too. One was in January 2020 on Jimmy Kimmel Live! when he showed off a bandaged nose; another happened months later in March on Saturday Night Live.</p><img alt="jimmy kimmel live jimmy kimmel live airs every weeknight at 1135 pm est and features a diverse lineup of guests that include celebrities, athletes, musical acts, comedians and human interest subjects, along with comedy bits and a house band the guests for wednesday, january 22, included colin farrell the gentlemen, dave salmoni the puppy bowl, and musical guest the weeknd randy holmes via getty images the weeknd" title="ABC&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live&amp;quot; - Season 18" width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1197148055.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Randy Holmes</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>At Jimmy Kimmel Live! in January 2020.&nbsp;</p><img alt='saturday night live "daniel craig" episode 1782 pictured l r kate mckinnon, senator elizabeth warren, host daniel craig, musical guest the weeknd, and rachel dratch during goodnights credits on saturday, march 7, 2020 photo by will heathnbcnbcu photo bank via getty images' title="Saturday Night Live - Season 45" width=1334 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1205774767.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">NBC</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>On stage at&nbsp;Saturday Night Live in March 2020.&nbsp;</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">By the time he hit the red carpet at the MTV Video Music Awards in August, he had ditched the nose bandage but still wore bruising special-effects makeup.</p><img alt="2020 mtv video music awards – arrivals" title="2020 MTV Video Music Awards – Arrivals" width=682 height=1024 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/the-weeknd-attends-the-2020-mtv-video-music-awards-news-photo-1612537421.?resize=640:*" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Kevin Mazur/MTV VMAs 2020</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Arriving at the MTV VMAs in August 2020.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At the American Music Awards in November, he raised questions in a fully bandaged face and deeply reddened under-eyes, as if he was recovering from an operation or severe injury.</p><img alt="2020 american music awards show" title="2020 American Music Awards - Show" width=1896 height=2844 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/in-this-image-released-on-november-22-the-weeknd-accepts-news-photo-1612538038.?resize=640:*" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Kevin Mazur</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Accepting a trophy at the AMAs in November 2020.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Most recently, in early January of this year, the singer uncovered a freakish, botched Botox look in his <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/art-books-music/a35132053/the-weeknd-face-save-your-tears-video/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="“Save Your Tears” music video" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">“Save Your Tears” music video</a>. The special-effects makeup came courtesy of Prosthetic Renaissance, the group that had worked the singer through his various cosmetic transformations.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s unclear if The Weeknd will appear on the Super Bowl stage with a similar—or perhaps more extreme—appearance, but if he does, know that there’s more where it came from.</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67055711-c808-4a4d-811a-e7155a2bce10_1667409691.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" title="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Erica Gonzales is the Senior Culture Editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage on TV, movies, music, books, and more.
