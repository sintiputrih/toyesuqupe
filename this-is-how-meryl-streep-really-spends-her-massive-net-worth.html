After all, most major movie stars are defined by their ability to headline blockbuster films that bring audiences in with massive explosions and mindblowing stakes. On the other hand, even though <a href=#>Streep has headlined many financially successful movies</a>, she is best known for her acting chops that are among the best in history.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Every year when lists about <a href=#>the highest-paid actors in Hollywood</a> are published, they are dominated by actors who are known for blockbuster films like Dwayne Johnson and Tom Cruise. Despite that, Meryl Streep has been a force in Hollywood long enough to amass a fortune that could rival most of those stars. With that in mind, it begs an obvious question, how does Streep spend her massive net worth?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's How Meryl Streep Got Her Big Break... Is She The Best Actress Of Her Generation?</a></span></p><h2 id=streep-rsquo-s-biggest-purchases>Streep’s Biggest Purchases</h2><p>Whenever people take a look at the ways that famous people spend their money, there are a couple kinds of things that always get top billing. Of course, that makes perfect sense since buying homes and cars can be extremely expensive. On top of that, owning expensive cars and homes is a great way for stars to show off and most celebrities seem to love doing that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unlike a lot of her peers, Meryl Streep has never seemed overly interested in flaunting her wealth to the public. Despite that, Streep seems to have a love for expensive homes and cars just like most of Hollywood stars. For example, according to reports, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Streep owns a BMW Hydrogen 7</a> which is something most people could only dream of since they had a $118,000 base price. It seems safe to assume that Streep’s BMW cost more than that too since she could afford to have it tricked out. After all, according to celebritynetworth.com, Streep is worth $160 million as of this writing. It should also be noted that Streep almost certainly owns some other expensive vehicles as well.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Celebs That Never Show Us Their Car Collections (5 That Show Too Much)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over the years, <a href=#>Mery Streep has bought a lot of homes</a> alongside her longtime husband Don Gummer. For example, it is known that the couple bought a 4,000 square-foot Tribeca Penthouse that boasted an open floor plan, a view of the Statue of Liberty, and four bedrooms. The Penthouse also contained four bathrooms, a powder room, a sitting room, walk-ion closets, and a media room.</p><p>It is also known that Meryl Streep bought a 3,087-square-foot Pasadena home that was built during the 1950s and highlighted by floor-to-ceiling windows, three bedrooms, three bathrooms, and a pool. Still not through, Streep is known to have bought a Salisbury, Connecticut home and a Hollywood Hills West Home in the past. Given all of the real estate that Streep has owned over the years, it is obvious that a good portion of her fortune has been used to make those purchases.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to the expensive cars and homes Mery Streep has bought, it is also known that she has spent a good amount of money on accumulating an enviable jewelry collection. On top of that, Streep has also enjoyed the fruits of her labor by going on several expensive vacations over the years.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Tragic Loss Led To Meryl Streep Finding Her Longtime Husband?</a></span></p><h2 id=giving-back>Giving Back</h2><p>Despite all of the ways that Streep has spent her fortune on her loved ones and herself, that doesn’t mean that she doesn’t have any cash left over to help strangers. Instead, it is known that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Streep has given a lot of her money to a long list of charities</a> over the years. In fact, it has been reported that Streep spends roughly $1 million on charity annually which is a staggering number. Thankfully, Streep isn't the only <a href=#>star who has donated their time and money to worthy causes</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In terms of the charities that Meryl Streep supports, it is clear that she wants to help people who are dealing with a wide array of challenges.

It is also worth noting that Streep has tried to help the environment by giving to The Rainforest Foundation. Even though all of those are a lot of charities for anyone to give to, they are only a sampling of the ones that Streep has supported.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Here's How 'The Devil Wears Prada' Changed Meryl Streep's Life</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroaGjYra0eceormallafGrXnSramenaBiv6aty6WwZqugmrulv4yhnKtlnZbAtLXVnmSnnaRixLC%2B06Fm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
