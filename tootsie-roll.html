He wakes up in the studio, disorientated, and thinks he's traveled through time. Babytron and Reuel, accompanied by ShittyBoyz, go on to boast about their wealth and luxurious lifestyle. The song includes a number of lines about street life, as well as numerous pop culture references such as Dragon Ball Z's Shenron and NBA player Dr. J.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>The Butterfly? Uh uh, that's old</u><br>I'm not interested in the Butterfly dance anymore.</p><br><p><u>Let me see the Tootsee Roll</u><br>I want to see you do the Tootsee Roll dance.</p><br><p><u>Damn, I done fell asleep in The studio and woke up Thought I went through a Time machine or something</u><br>I fell asleep while recording and woke up feeling disoriented.</p><br><p><u>This bitch crazy, Reuel (Reuel, stop playing with these niggas) yeah Okay, Reuel, yeah, yeah ayy, ayy, ShittyBoyz Damn, hold on (ShittyBoyz, ShittyBoyz) Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy (ShittyBoyz)</u><br>Talking to Reuel, the producer, while ShittyBoyz are in the studio.</p><br><p><u>Eyes red, I'll flame you up like Shenron Got every color fit it is, I'm the Tech God</u><br>I have red eyes and I can use my technology to defeat you like the Shenron dragon from Dragon Ball Z.</p><br><p><u>Real life scorer but I'm thinking 'bout the next slide Scope on this bitch so I Think this a headshot</u><br>I am confident in my ability to always score but I'm constantly thinking about the next move. I have a scope on my gun and I think I can make a headshot.</p><br><p><u>Damn, Turtle Piе, this a head hot Donate a flatline to him, hе a dead guy Yo main mans a burger so I'ma call you "French Fry"</u><br>Turtle Pie is going to get shot in the head and die. Your friend is a burger, so I'm going to call you French Fry.</p><br><p><u>Just made ten, still got crust in my left eye Big Moncler Fuck around and tuck a rocket launcher</u><br>I just made 10 dollars but I still have crust in my left eye. I'm wearing a big Moncler jacket and I am capable of hiding a rocket launcher.</p><br><p><u>Boy plugged in Two shots gon' stop the Charger You ain't never scored a point, boy I'm probably not gon' guard you</u><br>I am connected and powerful. I can stop a Dodge Charger with two shots. You've never scored a point before so I'm not going to guard you.</p><br><p><u>Made seven then I made six, bitch, I'm Dr j OBJ, one hand, I ain't drop the play</u><br>I scored 7 points then 6 points - I'm like Dr. J. I'm like Odell Beckham Jr. when I play one-handed and don't drop the ball.</p><br><p><u>My hotheads locked in, make you unlock a safe If it's busts then I'm there, Tom Brady Chrome Hearts on, black heart You cannot break me two sticks on me but I Promise you cannot play me</u><br>I am focused and determined. I can open a locked safe. If there's any shooting going on, I'm there like Tom Brady in a football game. I have Chrome Hearts on, hiding my black heart. You can't stop me and I'm always armed - but you still can't beat me.</p><br><p><u>I'ma probably shoot both of 'em Till the SWAT take me</u><br>I might shoot both of them and I expect the SWAT team to come after me.</p><br><p><u>Hold on, turn around, touchdown, flex Hold on, bitch, can't fuck, just neck</u><br>I'm celebrating a touchdown then flexing. But don't expect to have sex with me - I'll just ask you for head.</p><br><p><u>Fucked up Chase with a fucked up check If you fuck with gang, you get fucked up next</u><br>I messed up a check from Chase Bank and if you mess with my gang, you're going to get hurt.</p><br><p><u>Off White trunks, how I jump in wet? Ran it up chilling, how the fuck I sweat?</u><br>I jumped in the water wearing Off-White trunks but I didn't get them wet. I made a lot of money while relaxing - how did I break a sweat?</p><br><p><u>Lil' bitch a zombie, she suck my flesh Bitch, you ain't the only one I text</u><br>I have a girl who is like a zombie - she's always up for sex. But you're not the only one I text.</p><br><p><u>Slide, slide hellcat finna fly Got big drip like I'm tipped on my side I don't work shit, shift drift when I drive</u><br>I'm sliding in my Hellcat (Dodge car) and it feels like it's about to fly. My style is amazing. I don't have a regular job, but I do drift when I'm driving.</p><br><p><u>Glock pick him up, he get lift Ain't no ride You down one but the clock buzz Ain't no time You could be on a skateboard and don't grind</u><br>If I shoot someone with a Glock gun, they'll go flying. You can't ride with me though. If you're down in a competition and the clock is ticking, there's no time to waste. You could be on a skateboard and not be good at it.</p><br><p><u>Talk shit on fake page, know you hate yo life Off White but the switch on on the AR Had to switch clothes from my face card</u><br>If you talk trash on social media, you must hate your life. I have an Off-White designer switch on my AR gun. I had to switch clothes so no one recognizes me from my ID.</p><br><p><u>Thinking you fucking with me? You Off a laced bar Thinking you keeping up? You better Have a race car i ate lamb chops in a i8</u><br>You're not in my league if you're under the influence. You better have a fast car if you think you can keep up with me. I had lamb chops while driving in a BMW i8 car.</p><br><p><u>I ain't finna fight you, I'm a lightweight Shoot him in the middle of a lie Guess he die fake</u><br>I'm not going to fight you - I'm not strong enough. Instead, I will shoot you if you lie to me. If you're not real, then you'll die.</p><br><p><u>Cut into the bitch like, "Boo My only type pretty"</u><br>I am very selective when it comes to girls - my only type is pretty ones.</p><br><p><u>Lil' bitch toxic, that head got a antidote I ain't even catholic I'll probably scam the pope If you ain't my girlfriend, I'll scam you Ho two things that yo bitch knows Is gag and choke</u><br>My girl is toxic but her head is like an antidote to me. I'm not even Catholic but I'm capable of scamming the Pope. If you're not my girlfriend, I'll scam you too. Your girl only knows two things: gagging and choking.</p><br><p><u>Bad bitch on my last Nerve 'cause she indecisive I'ma have withdrawals if we Don't hit Verizon</u><br>I have a pretty girl with me who's driving me crazy because she can't make up her mind. If we don't go to Verizon, I'll have withdrawal symptoms.</p><br><p><u>Might look mad but I swear That the pistol smiling</u><br>I might look angry, but in reality, I'm happy that I have a gun with me.</p><br><p><u>Stan ain't Vone but I swear he Got a pole by him donny fucking up New York I think Long Island Red beam on this bitch but it doesn't timing</u><br>Stan is not Vone (another rapper) but I'm sure he has a gun with him. Donny is causing trouble in New York and he's probably in Long Island. There's a red dot sight on my gun but it's not working properly.</p><br><p><u>Dee finna grab a new whip that has no mileage Yeah, be a hunnid, you don't punch up Money falling out my pocket Can't pick a one up</u><br>My friend Dee is about to buy a new car that has no miles on it. Yeah, be 100% real and don't be fake. There's so much money in my pocket that I can't even pick one bill up.</p><br><p><u>762s makes his ass do the Tootsee Roll Buffs with the ice cost more Than a Cookie 'bow Lil' skinny bitch but I swear That her pussy swole The Tootsee Roll I wanna see you Tootsee Roll tootsee Roll</u><br>If I shoot someone with a 7.62 mm bullet, they'll start dancing the Tootsee Roll. My sunglasses that have diamonds on them cost more than a luxury car. There's a skinny girl with a big vagina. I want to see you dance the Tootsee Roll.</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Lyrics © EMPIRE PUBLISHING</span></p><p>Lyrics Licensed & Provided by <a class=ext-link href=# rel=nofollow>LyricFind</a></p>To comment on or correct specific content, <span>highlight it</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn6O2pLTIrapnm5%2BifLe1w56maHqRl8a1vs6nZo2nn6nAqrG%2Bi6alpA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
