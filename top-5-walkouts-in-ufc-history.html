Here, we are talking about the top 5 walkouts in UFC history where fighters stuck the audience in awe of their mere walk before the fight. However, as ordinary in a process, it seems some people can make even a walkout so entertaining that you will start talking about the performer even before the performance.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=From_Brian_Ortega_to_Conor_McGregor_here_are_top_5_walkouts_in_ufc></span>From Brian Ortega to Conor McGregor, here are top 5 walkouts in ufc<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=5_Brian_%E2%80%9CT-City%E2%80%9D_Ortegas_UFC_266_walkout></span>5.

Ortega and his team went out on scary neon-painted, “Purge” styled masks that had the sketch of crossed eyes and stitched mouth, representing that the whole team belongs to one entity with a single purpose, to win. This is something new from Ortega and we can only hope for more such surprises!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=4_Kimo_Leopoldos_walkout_at_UFC_1_Finale></span>4. Kimo Leopoldo’s walkout at UFC 1 Finale<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Both the fighters of the main event, Royce Gracie and <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimo_Leopoldo rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Kimo Leopoldo</strong></a> had the most amazing walkouts of the night of the finale of the first-ever tournament by UFC and one of the best ever. So it was important to put both of them in the top 5 walkouts in UFC. Kimo came out with a giant, heavy cross, though with some assistance. Kimo wanted to represent his love for Jesus Christ. He indeed justified his faith in a very cool way!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=3_Conor_McGregors_walkout_at_any_event></span>3.

But nonetheless, the soothing Irish music with his flag illuminating all over the Octagon and the smoke across the octagon in some of his entrances have always been if an absolute spine-tingling moment, especially for the patriotic Irish fans for whom Conor has put them on the map of this sport. This brings at number 3 of the top 5 walkouts in UFC.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=2_Israel_Adesanyas_Walkout_at_UFC_243></span>2. Israel Adesanya’s Walkout at UFC 243<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>You can make a case for “The Last Stylebender” that all his walkouts are choreographed thinking in one direction and that is out of the box! So it’s obvious that perhaps his other walkouts are in someone else’s top 5 walkouts in UFC. Nonetheless, <strong><a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://firstsportz.com/ufc-israel-adesanya-speaks-on-jon-jones-arrest/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Adesanya</a>‘s</strong> street dance at UFC 243 is the one to be solidified as the most legendary one of the modern era UFC. And considering Adesanya became the UFC middleweight champion that night, this walkout feels like a hype yet to be unmatched for the years to come!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Royce_Gracies_Walkout_at_UFC_1_Finale></span>Royce Gracie’s Walkout at UFC 1 Finale<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>You can make a case for<a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royce_Gracie rel="noreferrer noopener"> <strong>Royce Gracie</strong></a> that he is the first number one pound-for-pound fighter in the history of the UFC. Not only that, Royce revolutionized the sport with something to be unforeseen at that time. UFC 1, a tournament that was perceived by the audience to go striking heavy, was suddenly a grappler’s arena of extreme dominance.</p><p>This walkout is the greatest and at the top of the top 5 walkouts in UFC for one big reason and that is this entry is symbolic of the arrival of the Gracie family (as you can see literally too) into the world of Mixed Martial Arts. This entry into the sport can be the first trace of the evolution of MMA.</p><p><strong>Also read – <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://firstsportz.com/ufc-dillon-danis-arrest-details/ rel="noreferrer noopener">“In the video, you see him tap and everything,” Bouncer details on the entire bar scuffle that led Dillon Danis’ arrest</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiemafAtb%2FPqKmtsl6YvK5706inZm1drK6tt86uq6xlmaN6trLCZp%2Biq6Skv7p7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
