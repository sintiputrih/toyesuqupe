Or maybe simply hoping to learn more about these exciting creatures? While they look similar to turtles, tortoises aren’t quite the same, and there is a lot that most people don’t know about them. If you’re a reptile lover at heart, put your knowledge to the test by checking out a few of these interesting facts about tortoises.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/petkeen.com/data:image/gif;base64></p><h2><span id=The_19_Facts_About_Tortoises>The 19 Facts About Tortoises</span></h2><h3 class=num-head><span id=1_Tortoises_are_turtles_but_turtles_arent_tortoises><span class=dhn>1.</span> Tortoises are turtles, but turtles aren’t tortoises.</span></h3><p>Yes, you did read that right. Although these two animals are related, <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel=nofollow>they aren’t the same</a> as one another. <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Turtles</a> are shelled reptiles that belong to the <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel=nofollow>Chelonii</a>&nbsp;order. On the other hand, a tortoise simply refers to a type of terrestrial turtle. There are a few exceptions to this rule. For example, there is a type of land-dwelling box turtle. But for the most part, turtles are aquatic, and tortoises aren’t.</p><p>An easy way to tell the difference between these two animals is by looking at the shells and feet. Aquatic turtles have webbed flippers and long claws with flatter shells. Tortoise’s feet are stubby with larger, domed shells.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/petkeen.com/data:image/gif;base64><h3 class=num-head><span id=2_Tortoises_are_ancient><span class=dhn>2.</span> Tortoises are ancient</span></h3><p>It’s a little hard to believe, but it’s true that tortoises have been roaming Earth for over&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel=nofollow>55 million years</a>.</p><h3 class=num-head><span id=3_A_creep_is_what_you_call_a_group_of_tortoises><span class=dhn>3.</span> A creep is what you call a group of tortoises.</span></h3><p>It isn’t common to see a creep because tortoises are solitary animals that roam around a lot. Some mothers are protective of their nests, though, so you can occasionally spot a creep if she decides to stick around. Still, she doesn’t tend to her young once they hatch.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h3 class=num-head><span id=4_They_live_a_very_long_time><span class=dhn>4.</span> They live a very long time.</span></h3><p>Even in the wild, healthy tortoises can live up to 150 years. There are a rare few that even lived longer than 200 years.</p><h3 class=num-head><span id=5_They_live_in_almost_all_climates><span class=dhn>5.</span> They live in almost all climates.</span></h3><p>If the climates are warm enough for them to breed, you are able to find tortoises on all continents except Antarctica.</p><h3 class=num-head><span id=6_They_have_over_60_bones_in_their_shells><span class=dhn>6.</span> They have over 60 bones in their shells.</span></h3><p>Each bone in a tortoise’s shell is connected to one another. <a href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal>It doesn’t look like it, but they are also able to feel when their shells are touches because of the nerve endings in them</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h3 class=num-head><span id=7_Weather_determines_gender><span class=dhn>7.</span> Weather determines gender.</span></h3><p>The gender inside of a tortoise egg isn’t determined right away. The weather plays a significant role in the sex of the hatchlings. When it’s cold, more males are born. When it’s warm, more females are born.</p><h3 class=num-head><span id=8_They_are_incredibly_slow><span class=dhn>8.</span> They are incredibly slow.</span></h3><p>Okay, maybe you already knew this, but for moving at only 0.2 miles per hour, they somehow travel up to 4 miles every day.</p><h3 class=num-head><span id=9_Weather_changes_their_shell_colors><span class=dhn>9.</span> Weather changes their shell colors.</span></h3><p>Weather doesn’t only play a role in their sex, but also the colors of their shells. Tortoises found in hot, desert climates have lighter colored shells to reflect light, and cooler climates produce darker colors that absorb more heat.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h3 class=num-head><span id=10_Tortoises_cannot_swim><span class=dhn>10.</span> Tortoises cannot swim.</span></h3><p>You would think that being so closely related to turtles would help you be a master swimmer, but <a href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal>tortoises cannot swim</a>. They can, however, hold their breath for up to half an hour.</p><h3 class=num-head><span id=11_They_smell_with_their_throats><span class=dhn>11.</span> They smell with their throats.</span></h3><p>A lot of reptiles, include tortoises, use their throats to smell instead of their noses. They have a&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel=nofollow>vomeronasal organ</a>&nbsp;on the roof of their mouths and pump air through the nose and around the mouth to use it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h3 class=num-head><span id=12_They_dont_have_teeth_but_still_chew_their_food><span class=dhn>12.</span> They don’t have teeth but still chew their food.</span></h3><p>Even without teeth, the sharp edges of their upper and lower jaws help them clamp down on food. Their tongues guide the food to the rear of their mouths for them to swallow.</p><h3 class=num-head><span id=13_They_have_two_skeletons><span class=dhn>13.</span> They have two skeletons.</span></h3><p>Tortoises have both an exoskeleton and an endoskeleton. You may not see it from the outside, but inside the tortoise’s body is a spine, collar bone, and ribs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h3 class=num-head><span id=14_Tortoise_scales_are_called_scutes><span class=dhn>14.</span> Tortoise scales are called scutes.</span></h3><p>Scutes are made of keratin, the same thing our fingernails are made from. The scutes protect the tortoise’s bone plates and keep them from being injured and getting infected. You can also see growth rings around the scutes that tell you how old they are, like tree rings.</p><h3 class=num-head><span id=15_Sulcatas_are_some_of_the_biggest_tortoise_species><span class=dhn>15.</span> Sulcatas are some of the biggest tortoise species.</span></h3><p>Sulcata tortoises live over 100 years and can weigh nearly 200 pounds. These gentle giants are the third largest in the world and the <a href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal>most popular choice for a pet</a>. They are only smaller than the Galapagos and Aldabra giant tortoises.</p><h3 class=num-head><span id=16_Charles_Darwin_and_Steve_Irwin_once_cared_for_the_same_tortoise><span class=dhn>16.</span> Charles Darwin and Steve Irwin once cared for the same tortoise.</span></h3><p>Is that timeline accurate? You betcha! Darwin collected a tortoise and named her Harriet back in 1835. She eventually wound up in the Australian Zoo that was founded by Irwin’s parents. She didn’t pass away until 2006, which was the same year that Irwin died.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h3 class=num-head><span id=17_They_survive_on_very_little><span class=dhn>17.</span> They survive on very little.</span></h3><p>Tortoises are masters at extracting even the smallest amount of<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal> food and water from each bite of food they take.</a> They have a&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel=nofollow>hindgut system</a>&nbsp;with a double digestive tract that separates water from their waste when sources are scarce.</p><h3 class=num-head><span id=18_They_reach_sexual_maturity_by_size_instead_of_age><span class=dhn>18.</span> They reach sexual maturity by size instead of age.</span></h3><p>It doesn’t matter how long they’ve been alive; tortoises are only sexually mature when they reach a certain size. Each breed’s sexual maturity size differs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h3 class=num-head><span id=19_Theyre_smarter_than_we_think><span class=dhn>19.</span> They’re smarter than we think.</span></h3><p>There was a&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel=nofollow>study</a>&nbsp;conducted in 2006 that places a rat and tortoise in the same maze. The reptile came out on top by navigating its way to the food source and never returning to the same area twice.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/petkeen.com/data:image/gif;base64></p><h2><span id=Conclusion>Conclusion</span></h2><p>If you’re a <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>reptile nerd</a>, then you may have heard one or two of these facts, but we bet you didn’t know all of them.
