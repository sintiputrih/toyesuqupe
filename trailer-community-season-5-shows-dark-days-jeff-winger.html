Though the fourth season was an undeniably poor outing for the cult meta-comedy, Dan Harmon is back in the saddle as showrunner, so the likelihood of Community&nbsp;returning to the same level of quality for which it has become renowned is quite high.</p><p data-characters=196 data-current-count=587 data-injectable=true>Today, NBC has revealed a concept trailer for the fifth season, focusing on protagonist Jeff Winger (Joel McHale), who finally graduated from Greendale Community College at the end of last season.</p><p data-characters=19 data-current-count=19 data-injectable=false>Check it out below:</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=19 data-injectable=false></p><p data-characters=313 data-current-count=332 data-injectable=false>It looks like Jeff is taking a page out of&nbsp;Breaking Bad&nbsp;lawyer Saul Goodman’s book, doing his best to snare customers with cheesy advertisements for his personal injury practice. However, judging by the look of those movers, it does not seem that life after Greendale has been all wine and roses for Jeff.</p><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=641 data-injectable=true>Luckily, Dan Harmon appears to be taking some much needed course correction after the poorly-received plot advances made by season four showrunners David Guarascio and Moses Port. Jeff comes back to Greendale as a professor, a move that, though obvious, should work to repair the dynamic of the show a little.</p><p data-characters=429 data-current-count=429 data-injectable=true>In the spirit of&nbsp;Community, the clip also features the Dean feeling a little too overjoyed by Jeff’s return, Leonard roaming the halls of Greendale, Abed providing gleeful meta commentary and some terrifically nutty costumes. Those with sharp eyes will also spot Ken Jeong’s Chang hovering in the background, new addition Jonathan Banks (Breaking Bad) as a shady criminology professor and fake show title <i>Mr. Winger</i>.</p><p data-characters=360 data-current-count=360 data-injectable=false>Though the trailer’s commitment to setting Jeff up as a teacher is understandable, I hope that this is just the start of a barrage of advertisements for&nbsp;Community, including ones that will hopefully feature the show’s actual title more prominently. We do want six seasons and a movie, after all, so getting fans to tune in for the premiere is key.</p><p data-characters=153 data-current-count=513 data-injectable=true>Will you be re-enrolling at Greendale next month?
