A former partner, Gareth Pursehouse, whose turbulent relationship with Harwick led to her filing a restraining order against him, was charged with murder and burglary.&nbsp;</p><p>But Wendy Williams wasn't going to let the sad details of the case deter her from making jokes. On <a href=#>her show</a>, she used a catchphrase from "The Price is Right" host Drew Carey to joke about his ex-fiance Harwick falling to her death, yelling: "Come on down!" Williams also summarized the case in her typically blunt way, informing her audience: "She was killed. Not by Drew." Her audience responded with shocked gasps and later viewers took to Twitter to express their shock at how callous Williams had been.&nbsp;</p><p>"For real, Wendy Williams is a sicko,"&nbsp;one <a href=#>Twitter</a> user wrote. A&nbsp;friend of Harwick <a href=#>declared</a> that it was a "CLASSLESS MOVE making a joke about a domestic violence victim," adding: "An amazing woman and champion for mental health awareness was senselessly killed and you used it as an opportunity for a one liner. HOW F***ING DARE YOU." Harwick's brother also demanded a public apology, telling <a href=#>Fox News</a>&nbsp;that the comments were unacceptable.</p><p dir=ltr>If you or someone you know is dealing with domestic abuse, you can call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1−800−799−7233. You can also find more information, resources, and support at <a href=#>their website</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmampjbX5zfo6uq62domKwsLnPpZytnV2ZvLi6xZqjpWWnmrulxYywoKWkmZa6tHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
