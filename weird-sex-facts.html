But how much do you really know about sex?</p><p>The answer to that question may very well be “not a lot,” and perhaps that’s because there are plenty of weird sex facts that you just don’t want to know. Here are a handful that may keep you out of the bedroom for a while — or maybe not:</p><img alt="Couple Having Sex" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/couple-having-sex.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=caption-body><strong>Sex can blow your mind -- literally.</strong><p><a href=#>Transient global amnesia</a> is a sudden, temporary loss of memory that's not attributable to any common neurological condition. So what can cause it? Sex.</p><p>Along with a very short list of other causes that also includes sudden immersion in hot or cold water, sex can literally wipe your memory. Thankfully, the condition is rare, temporary, and not likely to recur.</p><p>But why does this happen? In a <a href=#>2012 study published in the journal Stroke</a>, researchers contend that a particular kind of tensing and straining mostly in the abdomen and common during sex can put extreme pressure on your veins and allow deoxygenated blood to flow toward the brain, causing it to essentially short out.</p></span><span class=credit>LuckyBusiness /Getty Images</span> <img alt="Man Falling Down Stairs" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/man-falling-down-stairs.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=caption-body><strong>The list of weird fetishes is way longer and way more specific than you realize.</strong><p>The list of bizarre fetishes -- known in the medical community as paraphilias -- is truly staggering:</p><p>There's autoplushophilia (arousal at oneself dressed as a giant, cartoon-like stuffed animal), autonepiophilia (arousal at oneself in the form of an infant), climacophilia (arousal at falling down stairs), lithophilia (arousal at stone and gravel), and that's just the beginning.</p></span><span class=credit>FelixRenaud/Getty Images</span> <img alt="Kiss Bacteria" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/kiss-bacteria.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=caption-body><strong>During one kiss, you and your partner exchange 80 million bacteria.</strong><p>This figure comes courtesy of a <a href=#>2014 study published in Microbiome</a>. The researchers discovered that one ten-second kiss can transfer approximately 80 million bacteria of over 700 different varieties.</p><p>Of course, our entire bodies are home to an ecosystem of more than 100 trillion microorganisms. But fear not, neither the mouth nor body bacteria are, by and large, harmful.</p></span><span class=credit>Pixabay, NIAID/Flickr</span> <img alt="Shattered Banana" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/shattered-banana.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=caption-body><strong>The penis can break.</strong><p>While the human penis contains no bones, sudden and forceful bending of an erect penis during intercourse or masturbation can cause the corpus cavernosum (cylinders of tissue that make up the bulk of the penis) to fracture.</p><p>In the <a href=#>chilling words of the Mayo Clinic</a>, "A penis fracture is a painful injury. Signs might include a cracking sound, immediate loss of the erection, or the development of dark bruising of the penis due to blood escaping the cylinder. Sometimes the tube that drains urine from the body (urethra) is damaged as well, and blood might be visible at the urinary opening of the penis."</p></span><span class=credit>Musicphone1/Getty Images</span> <img alt="Shirtless Man Cracking Knuckles" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/shirtless-man-cracking-knuckles.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=caption-body><strong>Some men break their penises on purpose.</strong><p>In a practice known as <a href=#>taqaandan</a> ("to click" in Kurdish), men will hold the lower shaft of their erect penis with one hand then use the other to quickly snap the upper shaft.</p><p>When done correctly, taqaandan is said to be painless, a habit akin to knuckle-cracking.</p><p>Why do these men do it? According to Dr. Javaad Zargooshi, a urology professor at Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences in Iran who's <a href=#>published work</a> on the subject, taqaandan causes a loss of erection and a "satisfying popping noise." So, perhaps the practice is used to get rid of unwanted erections.</p></span><span class=credit>MaxRiesgo/Getty Images</span> <img alt="Chimp Woman Kiss" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/chimp-woman-kiss.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=caption-body><strong>Women are aroused by chimpanzee porn.</strong><p>A <a href=#>2005 study published in Biological Psychology</a> gathered 18 heterosexual women and 18 heterosexual men and showed them several pornographic films featuring humans and one featuring chimpanzees. Men showed neither objective nor subjective sexual arousal when viewing the chimpanzee porn, but women did.</p><p>Moreover, the researchers found that while the men showed genital arousal only to female pornographic stimuli, the study's female subjects showed genital arousal to both male and female pornographic stimuli. in the researchers' words, "These results suggest that stimulus features necessary to evoke genital arousal are much less specific in women than in men."</p></span><span class=credit>ALAIN JOCARD/AFP/Getty Images</span> <img alt="Flying Fox" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/flying-fox.jpg> <span class=caption-body><strong>Bats engage in oral sex.</strong><p>A <a href=#>paper published in PLOS ONE in 2013</a> reported that bats (including the short-nosed fruit bat and the as-terrifyingly-enormous-as-it-sounds Indian flying fox [above]) engage in both fellatio and cunnilingus.</p><p>And other than some unproven theories about female bats using fellatio as a way to disinfect the male's penis or males using cunnilingus as a way to lick out competing sperm, it seems that bats practice oral sex for the very same reasons we do.</p></span><span class=credit>Ian Waldie/Getty Images</span> <img alt="Crocodile Head Above Water" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/crocodile-head-above-water.jpg> <span class=caption-body><strong>Crocodile dung and sour milk were once used as contraceptives.</strong><p>The next time you're about to disparage current contraceptive methods, just remember that the ancient Egyptians sometimes used the crocodile feces as well as sour milk to prevent pregnancy. Both were applied intravaginally and during the act.</p><p>Modern theories suggest that the milk increased the vagina's acidity enough to degrade any sperm that might enter while the crocodile dung was alkaline enough to act as a spermicide.</p></span><span class=credit>ALAIN JOCARD/AFP/Getty Images</span> <img alt="Elderly Dancing" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/elderly-dancing.jpg> <span class=caption-body><strong>As much as 30 percent of Americans over 80 still have sex regularly.</strong><p>A <a href=#>2010 study published in The Journal of Sexual Medicine</a> found that between 20 and 30 percent of American men and women over the age of 80 remain sexually active.</p><p>The researchers also found that physical health was the most common predictor of sexual satisfaction for men in this age group. For women, it was relationship status. and across the board, researchers found that sexually active senior citizens simply aren't using protection.</p></span><span class=credit>TwilightProductions/Getty Images</span> <img alt="Weird Sex Facts Elderly" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/weird-sex-facts-elderly.jpg> <span class=caption-body><strong>STDs are now rampant and rising among the elderly.</strong><p>According to CDC data <a href=#>reported in the New York Times</a>, between 2007 and 2011, the rate of chlamydia infections for Americans 65 and older rose by 31 percent, while syphilis rose by 52 percent. Additionally, <a href=#>CBS reported</a> on a <a href=#>British study</a> that found that the number of new HIV infections among U.S. and U.K. citizens over the age of 50 doubled in the 2000s.</p><p>These figures actually make perfect sense. One of America's largest and comparatively less sexually educated generations (the Baby Boomers) is now in the senior citizen bracket and we now have the medicine to keep them healthy longer, the drugs to keep them sexually active longer, and the nursing homes to house them.</p></span><span class=credit>Vitranc/Getty Images</span> <img alt="Money In Garter" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/money-in-garter.jpg> <span class=caption-body><strong>Men over 60 who pay for sex do so more often as they age.</strong><p>Despite what we may think -- and may like to think -- about declining sex drives among the elderly, a <a href=#>2015 study published in the American Journal of Men's Health</a> found that for men between the ages of 60 and 84, the older they were, the more frequently they paid for sex.</p><p>What's troubling is that, likewise, as men who pay for sex get older, they're less likely to use protection. Of the men studied, 60 percent reported not always using protection with prostitutes.</p></span><span class=credit>FabioDerby/Getty Images</span> <img alt="Woman Eating Banana" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/woman-eating-banana.jpg> <span class=caption-body><strong>A third of Americans ages 75-85 still have oral sex.</strong><p>One one more sex fact from the land of senior citizens.</p><p>A comprehensive <a href=#>2007 study published in The New England Journal of Medicine</a> found that 31 percent of Americans ages 75-85 engage in oral sex.
