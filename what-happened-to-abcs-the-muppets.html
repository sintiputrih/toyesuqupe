It's neither the most recent nor best received, but the show brought Kermit and pals into the 21st century.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The more mature take on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jim Henson's beloved property</a> ran for one season on ABC in a compendium of sixteen episodes. These established slightly different origins for everyone's favorite Muppets, allowing for further growth. Fozzy, for instance, went from being Kermit's bumbling friend to his own person. The lovable bear's relationship actually became a prominent subplot in a few episodes, wherein he dealt with ditching his old jokey personality to be serious for his girlfriend at the time. It didn't conclude on the best of terms, but the whole Fozzy plot ended on an open note, one that allowed for more exploration in a sophomore season.</p><p>Sadly, ABC canceled the show after just one season, and after a finale that seemingly hinted at a season renewal.</p><h2 id=the-cliffhanger>The Cliffhanger</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/muppets.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the freshman season's closing episode, Kermit and Miss Piggy were in the midst of a lover's quarrel. The finale took some unexpected twists and turns, leaning in different directions. And in the end, Piggy was left with a life-changing decision on the tip of her tongue.</p><p>Seconds away from telling Kermit whether they were getting back together or ending things for good, Piggy falls asleep. Having taken a sleeping pill, Miss Piggy was out for the count. To make matters worse, they were aboard a flight set to return a month later. That meant Piggy and Kermit would be stuck together for the same amount of time. A cliffhanger, unfortunately, left us wondering what would happen to them in Season 2.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How A TV Commercial Inspired 'Space Jam'</a></span></p><p>The point is that season two seemed like a certainty before its' abrupt cancellation. All of the character threads pointed in that direction as well. The show could've gone on for another three seasons, yet it was cut short due to low ratings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While ABC's The Muppets did much to break ground in several areas, the reboot didn't rake in the ratings that the network expected. Granted, it got off to a good start. But as the season progressed forward, it ended with lackluster results in Nielsen estimates.</p><h2 id=disney-reboot>Disney+ Reboot</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/muppets-now.jpg><p>Since then, the property's parent company has rebooted the Muppets yet again. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Disney</a> ditched the mockumentary style that ABC adopted for an even more modern take called Muppets Now. The newest version consisted of streaming shorts in the vein of YouTube and personal camming, a trend that's become popular in recent years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Keep in mind that Disney has yet to come to a decision on what's to come of Muppets Now after a freshman season of six episodes. They aired towards the end of 2020, so it's a bit premature to conclude anything. However, without an official renewal, it could be a sign that the media giant is axing this reboot as well.</p><p>As much as it would pain us to learn that yet another Muppet show is getting canceled, it might not be so bad. Considering how terrible Kermit The Frog's new voice is, maybe the time is right for yet another revamp.</p><h2 id=what-lies-ahead>What Lies Ahead</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/muppet-caper.jpg><p>If anything, Disney should consider resurrecting the traditional format for a new film. The recent reboots starring human characters with Muppets as supporting players didn't work out very well, which is why putting the original trio back in the spotlight would be best.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kermit, Gonzo, and Fozzy's adventures in The Great Muppet Caper (1981) and The Muppet Movie (1979) are why generations of young fans came to love Jim Henson's masterful characters. Returning to that format would renew interest in the property, possibly opening the door to sequels if the adventures are as captivating as the Muppet Caper heist or the nonstop chase in The Muppet Movie.</p><p>Whatever happens, Disney has a tough decision to make. Do they take a gamble on another season of Muppets Now, or does the company reevaluate the pros and cons of a movie reboot? Only time will tell.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Happened To Kanye West's Hip-Hop Puppet Show</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8bq3BnKpmrJiaeq7Bz6mcratf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
