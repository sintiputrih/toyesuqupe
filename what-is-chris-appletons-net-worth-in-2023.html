He and Lukas Gage, his short-lived husband, got engaged — and then quickly married — earlier this year, only to announce their impending divorce in mid-November. The blossoming actor and celebrity hairstylist <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">only lasted around six months</a> as a married couple, and now they’re headed toward a bitter divorce.</p><p data-characters=399 data-current-count=789 data-injectable=true>That divorce could hit either half of the pair right where it hurts — in the wallet. One half of almost every failed marriage takes a hit when that marriage fails, and the impending court proceedings could see the wealthier half of the pair go down a tax bracket. That’s assuming they didn’t sign a prenup, of course, and that their assets weren’t protected through other means.</p><p data-characters=264 data-current-count=264 data-injectable=false>Appleton has a far more lengthy career behind him, so its fair to assume that he likewise has more in the bank — for now, at least. Once <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the divorce proceedings conclude</a> he may be sitting on a far smaller sum, but for now Appleton is doing just fine for himself.</p><h2 id=h-chris-appleton-s-2023-net-worth data-injectable=false>Chris Appleton’s 2023 net worth</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Chris-Appleton.jpg><p data-characters=474 data-current-count=474 data-injectable=true>Chris Appleton doesn’t boast the A-list name recognition his former husband is currently flirting with, but he’s been thriving among the stars for decades. The 40-year-old was styling the stars long before his 28-year-old former hubby waltzed onto the scene, and he’ll no doubt continue for years to come. He a top pick among some of Hollywood’s biggest stars, with clientele like Katy Perry, Ariana Grande, and Kim Kardashian frequenting his chair.</p><p data-characters=403 data-current-count=403 data-injectable=true>He’s been among Hollywood’s go-to hairstylists for around a decade now, and the hard work he’s put in payed off. The 40-year-old stylist is worth <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">between $2 and $5 million</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according</a> to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">numerous sources</a>, making him at least a burgeoning millionaire. Those higher-end estimates are a bit more common among reports, however, with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Net Worth Spot</a> even elevating it to a full $5.8 million.</p><p data-characters=618 data-current-count=618 data-injectable=false>All that money largely comes from his high-dollar styling opportunities, but Appleton’s popular Instagram account may also help cushion his bank account. He gets tens of thousands on views on pretty much any image he uploads, and sponsors pay top dollar for that kind of exposure. He likely pulls in more than a million a year at this point, and even once taxes and everyday expenses are considered, Appleton’s bank account is plenty stacked. And, since he and Gage signed a prenuptial agreement ahead of their wedding, both halves should be able to exit the relationship without too much financial stress.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqCsZZOdv6q%2FjJqnqaSVqbyvv4ynnK1lp6S%2FtbSMoqVmamBngHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
