The episode’s antagonist overpowers Bella Ramsey’s character, and in his final moments, he shows his true colors and the bone-chilling evil at his core.</p><p data-characters=336 data-current-count=336 data-injectable=false>Thankfully, Ellie manages to get away with her life, stabbing his face over and over in a frenzied state, reducing David’s head to a pulpy mess. Joel catches up to Ellie in the aftermath of the horrifying conclusion, and the pair embrace, with the now-healed smuggler calling his “cargo” his “baby girl.”&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=268 data-current-count=604 data-injectable=true>Both injured and shaken, the pair walk away and the credits start to roll with a score that appears to bear the trademark melancholy guitar progression of the original game’s soundtrack.

This may perhaps be the best place to find it if you’re yearning for a melancholy and solemn electric guitar tune to add to an ethereal playlist, or wherever it may fit in your music library.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMCtZKynnpx6sbjAsqpmoZ5iwamxjKWYrKxdpLNuwdJmnKmho6SxpnmXZpqrnZSewbR7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
