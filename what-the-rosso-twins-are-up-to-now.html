And while&nbsp;Camilla and Rebecca Rosso obviously lived in America while they were acting and working, they're originally from England, something they were especially proud of.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=#>Kidz World</a>,&nbsp;Becky explained that she and her sister really enjoyed the experience of living in both England and the United States. "We've lived in Los Angeles for about 3 and a half years," she said in the 2009 chat. "We love America! We love the weather in California and everyone's been so friendly to us, but we do miss our family and friends in England, so we go back every summer when we can."&nbsp;</p><p>Becky also added that the two didn't have too hard of a time adjusting to life in America, as there weren't a lot of changes. "We have school, homework, we go and see a movie at the weekend with our friends, and we go to the shopping mall in both places," she continued, though she did note that Americans don't drink nearly as much tea as English people do.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEpaCsrF6YvK57kXJra2loZMSprdNmq6GdXae8tL%2FOZquwoZ6oeqK%2BxGasqWWkpHqvu9Zo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
