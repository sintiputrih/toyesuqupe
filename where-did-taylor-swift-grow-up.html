We've got all the details for you here.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where did Taylor Swift grow up?</h2><p>OK, so Taylor did technically sort of grow up in Tennessee, but she wasn't born in Tennessee. Let's start from the beginning, shall we Swifties in training?</p><p>Taylor was born on Dec. 13, 1989, in Reading, Pa. However, her family moved to the neighboring town of Wyomissing (that's not Wyoming y'all, it's another city in Pennsylvania!) It was in Wyomissing that <a href=#>Taylor's father</a>, Scott Swift, bought an 11-acre Christmas tree farm because he was a stockbroker ... and that's what they do as a side hustle.</p><p>Taylor literally penned and recorded a song titled "Christmas Tree Farm," which referenced where she grew up in Taylor's trademark artistic, lyrical manner.</p><p>To clarify, Taylor didn't grow up solely on the Christmas tree farm. But her family did visit it frequently after Taylor's dad purchased it from a client of his, per a report from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Refinery29</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I actually did grow up on a Christmas tree farm. In a gingerbread house, deep within the yummy gummy gumdrop forest. Where, funnily enough, this song is their national anthem. <a href=#>#ChristmasTreeFarm</a> song and video out now ðŸŽ„<a href=#>https://t.co/p9Hk8blYpS</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/rTdGd1wIhK</a></p>â€” Taylor Swift (@taylorswift13) <a href=#>December 6, 2019</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The Wyomissing house Taylor grew up in is no longer owned by her family.</h2><p>The reason why the Swift family packed up their things and moved to Tennessee when Taylor was a teen was to help her budding singing career.</p><p>And per a report from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Philadelphis Inquirer</a>, the original Swift family home in Wyomissing no longer belongs to the Swift family.</p><p>So, what state does Taylor consider home now, given that she has been on the road so much?</p><p>As <a href=#>Distractify</a> reported previously, Taylor has been able to purchase multiple homes herself over the years, buying properties in Tennessee, Los Angeles, and Rhode Island (she has sold several of the houses since, but we need to appreciate that she was able to purchase multimillion dollar properties in cash.)</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift)</a></p></figure><p>Back in 2021, Taylor actually moved into a residence in London with her ex, <a href=#>Joe Alwyn</a>, but it's safe to presume that she probably isn't living across the pond in London anymore.</p><p>As for Taylor's childhood home on 78 Grandview Blvd in Wyomissing? It's currently off the market, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Redfin</a>, having been sold for an estimated $800K in 2022. And while you can't visit Taylor's childhood home, you can check out the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor Swift Museum</a> because its entirely virtual! (And cheaper than a ticket to the Eras tour!)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmvsRmm6KcXamuurjOq2Ssr5mbwW6z0aiuZq2g</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
