It becomes even more remarkable when siblings achieve this feat. While it is not uncommon for brothers to play in the NHL, some families have produced multiple siblings who have made their mark in the league. This article explores some of the families who have had the most siblings play in the NHL and highlights their achievements.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>The Sutter Family</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>The Sutter family is synonymous with hockey excellence. Hailing from Viking, Alberta, the Sutters have an impressive legacy in the NHL. Six brothers from the Sutter family have played in the NHL, making them the family with the most siblings to do so. The six brothers are Brent, Brian, Darryl, Duane, Rich, and Ron. Together, they have collectively played over 5,000 games in the NHL. The Sutters are known for their hard-nosed playing style and their contributions both on and off the ice.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>The Staal Family</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Another notable hockey family is the Staal family. The Staal brothers, Eric, Jordan, Marc, and Jared, have all made their mark in the NHL. Originally from Thunder Bay, Ontario, the Staal brothers have brought their unique skills to the league. Eric Staal, the oldest brother, has enjoyed a successful career, winning the Stanley Cup with the Carolina Hurricanes in 2006. Jordan Staal has also had a successful career, becoming known for his defensive prowess. Marc Staal has been a reliable defenseman throughout his career, while Jared Staal had a shorter stint in the NHL.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>The Sedin Twins</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Henrik and Daniel Sedin, known as the Sedin twins, are another remarkable pair of siblings who have left an indelible mark on the NHL. Hailing from Sweden, the Sedins played their entire NHL careers together, primarily with the Vancouver Canucks. Known for their exceptional playmaking abilities and telepathic connection on the ice, the Sedins were instrumental in leading the Canucks to the Stanley Cup Final in 2011. Henrik Sedin won the Hart Trophy as the league's most valuable player in 2010, while Daniel Sedin won the Art Ross Trophy as the league's leading scorer in the same year.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>The Hughes Brothers</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>The Hughes brothers, Quinn and Jack, are the latest addition to the list of siblings playing in the NHL. Quinn Hughes, a defenseman, was drafted seventh overall by the Vancouver Canucks in the 2018 NHL Draft. He quickly established himself as a dynamic and skilled blueliner, earning a Calder Trophy nomination for the league's top rookie in 2020. Jack Hughes, the younger brother, was selected as the first overall pick in the 2019 NHL Draft by the New Jersey Devils. He is known for his speed, playmaking ability, and overall offensive prowess.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>While it is not uncommon for brothers to play in the NHL, certain families have produced multiple siblings who have left a lasting impact on the league. The Sutter family, with six brothers playing in the NHL, holds the record for the most siblings. The Staal brothers, the Sedin twins, and the Hughes brothers are also notable examples of families with multiple siblings playing in the NHL. These families have not only showcased their talent but have also contributed to the rich history and legacy of the NHL.
