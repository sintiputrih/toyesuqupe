What Does Cassidy Do?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Cassidy works as a fashion designer in Austin, Texas. She says she is a fan of “most forms of art” and enjoys “thrifting through your grandparent’s old clothes and knick knacks.” Cassidy graduated from Texas State University with a degree in Fashion Merchandising in 2020, according to her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>LinkedIn</a>. She was a member of the Fashion Merchandising Association while in school.</p><h2>2. Cassidy’s Sister Died Of An Overdose</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>Cassidy’s older sister,&nbsp;<strong>Catherine Clark</strong>, died of an accidental overdose in 2017. Cassidy wrote about the heartbreaking loss on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>. “I have never experienced such great sorrow in my life,” she shared. “Losing my only sister is like losing my heart, my mentor, my childhood. I don’t know how to sum up in words the emptiness I feel since you left this world, the ache of knowing that I did not get a chance to say goodbye, to remind you how dearly I love you.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Cassidy-Clark-survivor-season-43-embed2.jpg><h2>3. Cassidy Has 2 Brothers</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>In addition to her sister, Catherine, Cassidy also has two brothers. In an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Parade</a>, she recalled watching&nbsp;Survivor with her family growing up, and then joining fantasy leagues with her brothers as she got older. “My brother and I still uphold the tradition of doing a big feast for&nbsp;Survivor finales, which is what we did when we were kids,” Cassidy shared. “We all auditioned together, so it’s been a real family experience for me.”</p><h2>4. Cassidy Was Almost On Season 41 of ‘Survivor’</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Season 43 was actually Cassidy’s second chance at being on&nbsp;Survivor. She told&nbsp;Parade that she went through the casting process for the show’s 41st season, and was even picked to be a member of the cast. She was a week away from leaving to film in 2020 when COVID-19 hit. “They ended up reworking the cast and I was taken off of it,” Cassidy recalled. “I didn’t know if I was going to have another chance to play. I actually had to reaudition and send in another video, go through the whole process again even to get my spot back here.”</p><h2>5. Cassidy Is In A Relationship</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Cassidy often posts photos with her boyfriend,&nbsp;<strong>Matthew Harrison</strong>, on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>. They met in August 2019 and seemingly started dating later that year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2Kwor%2FSopuyZZOhrrO3jKysq66Zq7yzeZNyb25pZm58</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
