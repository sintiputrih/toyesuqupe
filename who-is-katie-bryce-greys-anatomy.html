Why? Because of a photo of the 'Grey's' cast celebrating the show's 350th episode.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>An eagle-eyed fan thinks <a href=#>a particular character will be returning</a> to <a href=#>Grey's Anatomy </a>&nbsp;â€” all because of a cast photo celebrating the show's 350th episode.&nbsp;</p><p>In the photo, Twitter user Luiza Shepherd noticed a blond woman in a white and black polka-dot blouse. "WHAT THE F--K IS KATIE BRYCE DOING THERE??? so that means they're bringing her back again," Luiza tweeted.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Katie Bryce exactly?</h2><p>In Luiza's tweet, she included photos of Katie's character in the Grey's Anatomy episodes, "A Hard Day's Night," and "My Next Life." Katie Bryce is portrayed by actress Skyler Shaye.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>WHAT THE FUCK IS KATIE BRYCE DOING THERE??? so that means they're bringing her back again? <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/le21X1iZKX</a></p>â€” luiza shepherd (@greyspostit) <a href=#>October 16, 2019</a></figure><p>Katie Bryce, as it turns out, is Meredith Grey's first patient from Season 1. Even though Katie, a 16-year-old pageant star, initially came in for a hospital visit because of an ankle injury, she ended up coming back because she started having seizures. Derek Shepherd was the doctor who treated her, but brilliant Meredith understood that her ankle was causing the seizures. (Katie had taken a fall during a pageant-related gymnastics routine, and Meredith believed the fall caused an aneurysm â€” she was right.)&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>Derek performed surgery on Katie and saved her life. Katie ends up coming back to the hospital 10 years (and 12 seasons) later in another episode when she starts experiencing more seizures. Derek is gone by that point (RIP, McDreamy!!). Katie goes to Meredith wondering what happened to him, and Meredith doesn't tell her right away.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">And now, it seems like Katie Bryce is back (maybe)...but why?</h2><p>Some fans think (hope) that it's because we're getting some MerDer flashbacks.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>so thatâ€™s mean we will get a little flashback of merder or?</p>â€” adðŸ¥” (the one who never sleep) (@patrickdempseek) <a href=#>October 16, 2019</a></figure><p>It's unclear if Katie is even back. There's nothing indicating that actress Skyler Shaye is coming back for a third episode. Her IMDb profile only has her down for two episodes â€” one in 2005, and one in 2016.&nbsp;Perhaps Skyler was simply invited to celebrate since she was one of the first actors to play a patient on the show.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What else has Skyler Shaye been in?</h2><p>Skyler, who's a 34-year-old Los Angeles native, has been in numerous TV roles, including Family Affair in 2002, Criminal Minds and Veronica Mars in 2006, and Ray Donavan in 2015. She's also known for playing Chloe in the 2007 Brats movie. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to her Instagram</a>, she's currently dating musician Christian Lopez.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>And, fun fact, she's a fan of Waffle House (celebs! They're just like us!).&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Tonight's episode of Grey's Anatomy, "It's Raining Men," will focus on Meredith's exposÃ©, and her wanting to make things right. It's unclear how Katie's character comes in, but who knows? Grey's Anatomy is known for its twists and turns.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=fr dir=ltr>Activate damage control mode. <a href=#>#GreysAnatomy</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/jFVWzhK9yz</a></p>â€” Greys Anatomy (@GreysABC) <a href=#>October 15, 2019</a></figure><p>Watch Grey's Anatomy tonight, at 8 p.m. on ABC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZKSZpJ6ybq7RspqeZZensrq%2FjJqlmqyfosY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
