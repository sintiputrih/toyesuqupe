Their love story is picture perfect: The couple met at work, and somewhere down the line they fell in love with each other.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Previously, Kimmel was in a relationship with his ex-wife, Gina Maddy-Kimmel. They got married in 1988, and had two kids together, Katie, 32, and Kevin, 30, before getting a divorce in 2002.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Ahead, everything you need to know about McNearney and her relationship with this year’s Oscar host.</p><h2 data-node-id=4 class="body-h2 css-1wfsl5s et3p2gv0">McNearney and Kimmel met at work.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Back in 2006, McNearney began working for Jimmy Kimmel Live!, eventually working her way up to the role of co-head writer and executive producer. However, she and Kimmel didn’t exactly have a meet-cute, according to her first impression of him.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">“When I first met him, he insulted me!” McNearney told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.glamour.com/story/molly-mcnearney-reveals-how-sh data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Glamour class="body-link css-d2yypp et3p2gv0">Glamour</a> in 2014. “The executive producer brought me into his office and said, ‘This is Molly; she’s my new assistant.’ Jimmy barely looked up from his desk until my EP said, ‘She competes in triathlons,’ and then Jimmy looked up at me and said, ‘That is really stupid! What a waste of time,’ she laughed. “That was the first and only thing he probably said to me the entire first year of working there.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Not only does McNearney do a ton of work behind the scenes, but you’ve also probably seen her on TV in episodes alongside Kimmel, and she’s hilarious.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Aside from working for Kimmel, McNearney is also the EP for the Emmys and the Oscars. She worked on the shows when Kimmel hosted the Oscars in 2017, 2018, and last year in 2023, and she’ll be returning again as he hosts this year.</p><img alt="90th annual academy awards backstage" title="90th Annual Academy Awards - Backstage" width=3000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/in-this-handout-provided-by-a-m-p-a-s-jimmy-kimmel-and-news-photo-1709324041.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-wudbrp e6iqukd2">Handout</span><span class="css-efig6y e6iqukd0">//</span><span class="css-wudbrp e6iqukd1">Getty Images</span></p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="body-h2 css-1wfsl5s et3p2gv0">McNearney and Kimmel started dating in 2010.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">At some point, their relationship as coworkers turned into something more, and by 2010 Kimmel and McNearney were dating. In the 2014 interview with Glamour, McNearney explained that “all the writers would socialize after the show, and we would just hang out more and more. We really liked each other as friends, and then it just kind of turned. He cooked for me, and that was it. It sealed the deal.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">They had a pretty great first date, too.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">“At one of the writers’ meetings—because Jimmy is always thinking about food—he asked us what our five favorite foods were,“ she recalled. "I listed mine, which were pizza, gnocchi pasta, a BLT, crab claws, and a cheeseburger. Shortly after, he had invited me to his house, and I was very nervous. I mean, this is my boss. I was thinking, I gotta be careful here. He opens the door, and the whole house smelled delicious. I walked in, and there was a pizza, a BLT, crab claws, cheeseburger, and gnocchi. He had made them all from scratch. I couldn’t believe it, and I realized how incredibly thoughtful and generous he really was.”</p><img alt="2010 vanity fair oscar party hosted by graydon carter arrivals" title="2010 Vanity Fair Oscar Party Hosted By Graydon Carter - Arrivals" width=2054 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/personality-jimmy-kimmel-and-molly-mcnearney-arrive-at-the-news-photo-1709323637.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-wudbrp e6iqukd2">Ethan Miller</span><span class="css-efig6y e6iqukd0">//</span><span class="css-wudbrp e6iqukd1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">McNearney admitted to Glamour that she was nervous to tell the Jimmy Kimmel Live! staff the news of their relationship.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">“I was very, very nervous because I love our writers so much, and we work so closely together. I was also the only female writer in the room at the time, and I didn’t want to change the dynamic,” she explained. “We love to make fun of Jimmy over here, myself included. When you have camaraderie with your co-workers, one of the parts of that is making fun of the boss a little bit, and now to think, ‘That’s the guy I’m dating,’ I didn’t want that to stop.”</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h2 css-1wfsl5s et3p2gv0">McNearney and Kimmel got engaged in South Africa in 2012 and were married by 2013.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">In August 2012, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/celebrity/jimmy-kimmel-engaged-to-jimmy-kimmel-live-co-head-writer-molly-mcnearney/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-d2yypp et3p2gv0">People</a> reported that Kimmel proposed to McNearney at Kruger National Park in South Africa while they were on a romantic getaway. They officially tied the knot one year later on July 13, in Ojai, California.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Of course some pretty big stars were on the guest list, like Jennifer Aniston, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, and Ben Affleck.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">In March 2015, McNearney jokingly called Kimmel “the greatest wife you could ask for” in <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://ew.com/article/2015/03/03/this-weeks-cover-jimmy-kimmel/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Entertainment Weekly" class="body-link css-d2yypp et3p2gv0">Entertainment Weekly</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">“When we started dating, I would go back and forth between my place and his,” she recalled. “I have my stuff at my house, and I like my own space. One time, he was in the bathroom for a very long time, and I just figured something was going on internally.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">“A few days later, he presented me with this big box that had two of everything in my makeup and Dopp kit, because he saw that I was lugging stuff back and forth, and he wanted me to be comfortable in his home,” she continued. “He was in the bathroom for that hour and a half with my bag going through every single thing: every lotion, razor, deodorant, shampoo, makeup.”</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="body-h2 css-1wfsl5s et3p2gv0">McNearney and Kimmel have two kids together.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Their children are aged 6 and 9.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">On July 10, 2014, McNearney gave birth to the couple’s first child together, Jane Kimmel.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">“Congratulations to my beautiful and very tough wife Molly on delivering our baby girl this morning,” Kimmel <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/parents/jimmy-kimmel-molly-mcnearney-welcome-daughter-jane/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=tweeted class="body-link css-d2yypp et3p2gv0">tweeted</a>. “Thanks for all your kind baby wishes—turns out, not ALL tweets are mean!”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Three years later, on April 21, 2017, McNearney and Kimmel welcomed their son, William John “Billy” Kimmel.</p><img alt="us entertainment cinema toy story 4" title="US-ENTERTAINMENT-CINEMA-TOY STORY 4" width=2832 height=4248 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/television-host-jimmy-kimmel-wife-molly-mcnearney-children-news-photo-1709325990.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-wudbrp e6iqukd2">VALERIE MACON</span><span class="css-efig6y e6iqukd0">//</span><span class="css-wudbrp e6iqukd1">Getty Images</span></p><h2 data-node-id=30 class="body-h2 css-1wfsl5s et3p2gv0">McNearney has opened up about their son’s health issues.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">The couple’s son, Billy, was born with a rare congenital heart condition called Tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia, and there was a hole in the wall of his heart that prevented oxygen from reaching his blood. He had to undergo two open heart surgeries before he turned one. His first surgery came at only three days old.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">In January 2018, McNearney appeared on the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://unqualified.com/episodes/jimmy-kimmel-and-molly-mcnearney/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Anna Faris Is Unqualified" class="body-link css-d2yypp et3p2gv0">Anna Faris Is Unqualified</a> podcast, where she spoke about the whole experience.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">“Billy’s great. He had his second surgery and he’ll have one more when he’s older. It was tough,” she recalled.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">“But kids are so resilient—he had open-heart surgery on a Monday, and we were home on Friday,” she added.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">May 1, 2017 was Kimmel’s first day back hosting his show since Billy’s heart surgery, and in his monologue, he tearfully told the story to viewers. He also used the time to push for universal healthcare.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/lifestyle-news/jimmy-kimmels-wife-head-writer-why-we-shared-babys-trauma-what-came-1063489/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="According to The Hollywood Reporter," class="body-link css-d2yypp et3p2gv0">According to The Hollywood Reporter,</a> Kimmel told McNearney, “I just want you to watch,” so she knew that her husband would be talking about Billy on the show, but she wasn’t prepared to see him get so emotional and vulnerable in front of the cameras.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">“So, there I am, in my living room breastfeeding Billy with my mom beside me, and we’re watching. I sobbed through the entire thing. I couldn’t believe the strength that it took to tell that story a week after it happened. He didn’t have to do that,” she shared.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">“Our family has excellent health care; he had nothing to gain from that. He did it for the other people whom we met in that hospital. He came home that night, and I just hugged him, and I wouldn’t let go,” she added.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Both McNearney and Kimmel have both been vocal about spreading awareness on Billy’s condition as well as the importance of good, accessible healthcare for all.</p><h2 data-node-id=44 class="body-h2 css-1wfsl5s et3p2gv0">McNearny is usually Kimmel’s plus-one to award shows and red carpets.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=45 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">The average American couple probably has a fun date night at the movie theater, but McNearney and Kimmel prefer premieres, award shows, and galas. Most recently, they attended the 75th Primetime Emmy Awards together. McNearney wore a textured, red long-sleeve dress, while Kimmel wore a classic black tux with a bowtie. We’ll soon see them at the 2024 Academy Awards.</p><img alt="75th primetime emmy awards arrivals" title="75th Primetime Emmy Awards - Arrivals" width=683 height=1024 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/jimmy-kimmel-and-molly-mcnearney-attend-the-75th-primetime-news-photo-1709328103.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-wudbrp e6iqukd2">Neilson Barnard</span><span class="css-efig6y e6iqukd0">//</span><span class="css-wudbrp e6iqukd1">Getty Images</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7prjLnmWcp51ksLa4066pnmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2SudYKYcXBrcWJkxKm7jKKqZqWfobm6ecycpZ6ZoqOyunnJoqSmsV2gtq65xKVksKGWmnw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
