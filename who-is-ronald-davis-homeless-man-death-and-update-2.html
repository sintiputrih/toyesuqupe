He passed away on the 30th of November 2019.</p><p>Davis’s cause of death has not surfaced on the internet yet. Likewise, no one has released Ronald’s obituary officially so far.</p><p>As a matter of fact, Ronald died in the absence of his family and relatives. He was all alone even when he took the last breath of his life.</p><p>Davis had a son named&nbsp;<strong>Tyron</strong>. But Tyron was unaware of the demise of his father for almost a month. To point out, he found his dad was dead as late as the 20th of December in 2019.</p><p>In fact, Ronald did not possess any identity proof while he was living in the streets. That made it difficult for the officials to search his relatives and family after his decease.</p><p>Besides, it is not clear where Ronald’s funeral was held. Also, there is no information about whether his son received his body or not.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=ronald-davis-homeless-man-chicago-update></span>Ronald Davis Homeless Man Chicago Update<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ronald Davis is resting peacefully in heaven as of today. The old man is relieved after having suffered a lot in his life.</p><p>Actually, Davis rose into popularity following a video in 2013. The clip has been viewed well over 27 million times on Facebook alone.</p><p>A group of students of&nbsp;<strong>DePaul University</strong>&nbsp;had shot the video, which seemed to be a part of their academics. A Media Ethics professor Kim Clark had supervised them at the time.</p><p>In no time, Ronald’s video went viral on the internet. The interview is powerful enough to change someone’s perception of the people they see frequently on the street.</p><p>Even though the homeless man is dead today, he has left with a strong message to this world. He passed away seeking dignity in this world where no one cares about people like him.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=ronald-davis-biography-%e2%80%93-who-was-he></span>Ronald Davis Biography – Who Was He?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ronald Davis’s biography touches anyone with a heart. But his bio has not been included on a Wikipedia page.</p><p>Davis was a vagrant man living around the corners of Chicago. His life prior to coming in the streets was never known.</p><p>Ronald will always be remembered for the words he put out in search of dignity for people like him. He said, “I’m not a bum, I’m a human being.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4yrpqeZnJl6pa3VoqpmoJ%2Bisq2x0qxkppmeYrGmrdOhZJqmlGLCsbDArZxmal8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
