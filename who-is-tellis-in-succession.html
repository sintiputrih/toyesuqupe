Even though we only heard his voice, Tellis makes a surprise appearance one last time. In case you may not have been paying attention, or may have forgotten about Tellis, here’s exactly how he came into play in this<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> final battle for succession.</a></p><h2 id=h-who-is-tellis data-injectable=false>Who is Tellis?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Tellis the useless Investment Banker who went to HBS is a low key great Succession character <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/oGmpn1n41C</a></p>— High Yield Harry (@HighyieldHarry) <a href=#>May 29, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=472 data-current-count=772 data-injectable=true>Introduced in the fourth season premiere episode, “The Munsters,” Tellis – portrayed by Kevin Changaris – joins the cast of Succession as a financial advisor. He first interacts with Kendall, Roman, and Shiv while conveying messages in hopes of guiding them through a resolution regarding the PGM deal. Frustrated by the siblings’ indecisiveness on the matter, he becomes increasingly more infuriated the longer the Roys take to make a call.</p><p data-characters=477 data-current-count=477 data-injectable=true>Although Tellis’ role is relatively brief, it provides some insight into his personality and his significance within the story, quickly becoming a source of comedy amidst the financial chaos. His primary function is to advise the Roys on whether they can achieve specific goals, particularly pertaining to finances. Additionally, Tellis demonstrates a certain cunning, as Roman mentions that he bills them for strategy advice, even on matters that may seem insignificant.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Succession-roy-colin.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Feature-image-of-Succession.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/succession.jpg><p data-characters=533 data-current-count=533 data-injectable=true>Ultimately, Tellis’ tendency to state the obvious is what generates all the buzz surrounding this seemingly unimportant character. Despite the siblings’ awareness that Tellis will, in the end, be absolutely useless to their case, he continues to work for the Roys as a financial advisor, profiting from his downright obvious asides. We can even say that he has the best job in the entire show, as he just stood there giving the most common sense advice, only to bill them for thousands of dollars for a few words.

As a matter of fact, we may never see any of the Roys ever again, but at least we can sleep soundly with the thought that the series was perfect from start to finish.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tM5moKxlpJq5rbXSZqCnZaOqsKSx0qygqKZf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
