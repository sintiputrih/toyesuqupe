Their shows presented a world of once-brewing fame and fortune, showcasing the fiery personality of each family member. However, the show very quickly grew in popularity, skyrocketing the Kardashians to become one of Hollywood's most talked-about families of all time. Now, many of them own highly successful businesses and have accumulated swathes of loyal fans across their social media platforms.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, with fame comes consequences — consequences the family has had to tackle head on. Some of these consequences include having to deal with invasions of privacy, such as over the top paparazzi and crazy stalkers. Both of these are common problems for celebrities, with some even stating that they feel like 'zoo animals.' Now, <a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a><strong> </strong>is taking action.</p><h2 id=the-kardashian-family-takes-security-very-seriously>The Kardashian Family Takes Security Very Seriously</h2><p>As the Kardashians have grown in popularity and fame, they have had to implement safety measures to protect themselves and their family.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, it turns out that the family takes the issue of security very seriously, leaving no stone unturned.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>First, they hire <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">security guards, who have strict protocols that they must follow</a>. Some of these include being prepared to fight off attackers, and not being allowed to talk to the press. They follow the family wherever they go, and security is around them at all times.</p><p>Other measures include having state-of-the-art security systems installed, with Kanye even shelling out for armored vehicles in the past.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Is Kim Kardashian's Net Worth Taking A Hit Following Her Divorce Settlement From Kanye West?">Is Kim Kardashian's Net Worth Taking A Hit Following Her Divorce Settlement From Kanye West?</a></span></p><p>According to Caitlyn Jenner, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the family also spends more than most celebrities on security measures</a>. Talking to People Magazine, she explained: "I bet you Kylie will spend anywhere between $300,000 and $400,000 a month.”</p><p>However, considering the heights of their fame, it seems to make sense that they would take such measures to protect themselves.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kim-has-had-to-deal-with-plenty-of-strange-stalkers>Kim Has Had To Deal With Plenty Of Strange Stalkers</h2><p>Despite having such high levels of security, the Kardashian family still occasionally has to deal with completely psychotic stalkers. More recently, Kim Kardashian has found herself with a stalker on her hands, and she had had to go to extreme lengths to resolve the problem.</p><p>According to Page Six, the stalker had claimed that he and Kim both communicated with one another 'telepathically', showing up at her home three times in the month of August. During these violations of her privacy, the man, named Andre Persaud, claimed to be armed, leading to Kim fearing that he could become violent.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Kim Kardashian Got An Award For SKIMS Amid Kanye West's Tirades Against Her Company">Kim Kardashian Got An Award For SKIMS Amid Kanye West's Tirades Against Her Company</a></span></p><p>The restraining order is set to last for a total of five years, and he will not be allowed to come within 100 yards of the socialite.

In 2021, another one of Kim's stalkers, known as Nicholas Costanza, violated the terms of his five-year restraining order against the reality star, when he was found trespassing at her home.</p><p>Before this incident, he had also sent her a diamond ring and plan-B morning after pill to the star, and had even been accused of harassing her family. Following the incident, he was arrested with a stalking charge.</p><h2 id=it-39-s-not-the-first-time-the-kardashians-have-had-to-deal-with-weird-stalkers>It's Not The First Time The Kardashians Have Had To Deal With Weird Stalkers</h2><p>Asides from Kim, Kendall, and Kylie have also been victims of deranged stalkers. In earlier seasons of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, fans witnessed Kylie received a ton of pizza boxes, which she hadn't ordered, with a message asking the reality star to marry them.</p><p>Of course, Kris responds vigilantly. However, since this moment was captured, Kylie has had to deal with plenty of other stalkers. In 2021, an obsessed fan violated a restraining order that she had against them, turning up at her house several times, including the day after Christmas. Following the incident, he was arrested.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2019, there was also another incident where a crazed stalker hopped over the gate of her house and into her private estate. Again, this stalker had violated the terms of the restraining order against them. While this is just example of two incidents, both Kendall and Kylie have had to deal with several stalkers over recent years.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Kim Kardashian Attempts To Shut Down Rumors That She's 'Talentless'">Kim Kardashian Attempts To Shut Down Rumors That She's 'Talentless'</a></span></p><p>Other <a href=#>celebrities are too often victims of stalkers</a>.
