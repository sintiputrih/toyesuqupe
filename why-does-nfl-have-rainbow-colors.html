Together, they have supported the fight against cancer and helped save lives through "Crucial Catch: Intercept Cancer."</p><p>According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Crucial Catch" campaign's official website</a>, the mission is to "fight cancer through early detection and risk reduction." The group — which includes the NFL, its teams, players, the NFL Players Association, and the American Cancer Society — provides people with "the tools they need to help them better understand early detection and ways to reduce their cancer risk."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Each year, every single NFL team raises awareness during their respective Crucial Catch game, which features "on-field and in-stadium Crucial Catch elements."

Even better? The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Crucial Catch funds</a> have reached 1.2 million people and supported:</p><ul><li>657,800 total cancer screenings</li><li>429,800 breast cancer screenings</li><li>141,500 cervical cancer screenings</li><li>83,400 colorectal cancer screenings</li><li>3,100 lung cancer screenings</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>If you're looking to get involved with the campaign, there are a few things you can do.

All you have to do is head to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NFL Auction website</a>, and from there, you have free reign to scroll through the items available. Like the merch, 100 percent of sales from the NFL Auction go to the NFL Foundation and are then given to the ACS.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOonKxlnpu5brTAr5xmqpGeu6O71maaqKSfp8A%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
