The previously unknown actor has been cast in several other projects since landing the starring role. Some fans even decided that <a href=#>he should be the next James Bond!</a></p><p>Thanks to Outlander, Sam doesn’t have to audition as much anymore. Looking back, he had a lot of auditions he didn’t get. Some of them were for huge films such as Lord of the Rings and Tron: Legacy. To that list, add Superman Returns.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Speaking to Just for Variety podcast, the Scottish actor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">recalled his audition for Superman</a>. He shared, “The movie, it was the Brandon Routh one, [directed by] Bryan Singer. I had a number of auditions and met the producers. We never screen tested or anything but it was the beginning of me coming to America and the audition process.”</p><p>He further added, “I realized that I needed to change my body shape for the roles I was going up for.” Obviously, Sam didn’t get the role of Superman in Singer’s 2006 film. But the valuable experience had an unexpected effect on him – changing his eating diets forever.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Truth About Sam Heughan’s Casting As Jamie Fraser In ‘Outlander’</a></span></p><p>Sam explained, “I grew up a pescatarian or sort of vegetarian-pescatarian. I didn’t start eating meat until I came to America when I was 24. It was all these delicious burgers and food…At the time I was auditioning for Superman. I had a trainer and he was like, ‘You need to get bigger. You need to be able to fill out the cape.’ He was like, ‘Eat more protein.’”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actor’s statements shed light on the strong pressure men face to get in top physical form for superhero roles, which often necessitates strict diet and fitness regimens. Good thing, the trainers for Superman Returns helped Sam bulk up.

It was great.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While fans are wondering if <a href=#>Robert Pattinson will return to reprise his role in The Batman 2</a>, many are still hoping to see Sam as the caped hero. The actor even admitted that he’s excited about the new Batman movie, but explained why he’s become weary of superhero films.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Who Could Be The Next Batman After Robert Pattinson?</a></span></p><p>He said, “I think that looks fantastic. I think the other superhero movies kind of lost their way a little bit. They’ve become too obese in a way. Anything character based, Batman’s a great one because he’s a superhero. He’s just a character. Something with a great backstory.”</p><h2 id=fans-react-to-sam-heughan-being-a-superhero>Fans React To Sam Heughan Being A Superhero</h2><p>When people think of Sam Heughan, many tend to also picture scenes of war on horseback, sweeping romances, puffy shirts, and all the other things he does on Outlander, the hit Starz TV series, as Jamie Fraser.
