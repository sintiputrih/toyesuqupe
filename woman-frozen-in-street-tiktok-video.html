The video, which was posted on TikTok by a guest user @unknown1575489 on July 11, 2023, shows a blonde woman dressed in a black top and white pants standing still on a pavement somewhere in the United Kingdom. She remains motionless for several seconds before she resumes walking normally. The video has amassed over 5.3 million views and over 500,000 likes on TikTok, and has also been shared on other platforms such as YouTube and Reddit.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_is_the_origin_of_the_Woman_Frozen_in_Street_TikTok_Video></span>What is the origin of the Woman Frozen in Street TikTok Video?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The video was originally recorded on Snapchat by an unidentified man who was across the street from the woman. He added an on-screen caption that read: “She was like that for a minute before.” He also narrated the video, saying: “Why is she frozen? Bruh, I’m trippin.” He sounded bewildered and amused by the woman’s behavior. He later uploaded the video to TikTok with the caption: “NPC caught lacking #npc #malfunction”. NPC stands for Non-Playable Character, a term used in video games to refer to characters that are controlled by the computer and have predetermined actions and responses. The term is also used as a slang to describe someone who behaves in a robotic or glitchy manner.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_did_people_react_to_the_video></span>How did people react to the video?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The video sparked a lot of reactions online, ranging from humorous to outraged. Some people joked that the woman was lagging, glitching, checking her inventory, or playing statues. Some people speculated that the video was evidence of simulation theory, which is the idea that reality is actually a computer-generated illusion. Some people compared the video to scenes from movies such as The Matrix or Inception. Some people expressed concern for the woman’s health and safety, wondering if she had a medical condition or was under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Some people criticized the man for filming and posting the video without the woman’s consent or knowledge. Some people accused the video of being fake or edited.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_the_video_real_or_fake></span>Is the video real or fake?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The authenticity of the video has not been verified by any official source. However, some users have pointed out some possible clues that suggest that the video might be fake or edited. For example:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Woman-Frozen-in-Street-TikTok-Video.jpg><ul><li>The woman’s shadow does not match her position or movement.</li><li>The woman’s hair does not move with the wind or her head.</li><li>The woman’s clothes do not crease or wrinkle with her body.</li><li>The woman’s posture and balance look unnatural and uncomfortable.</li><li>The traffic and pedestrians behind the woman do not seem to notice or react to her.</li><li>The man’s voice and caption do not sound genuine or spontaneous.</li></ul><p>On the other hand, some users have argued that the video might be real or unedited.
